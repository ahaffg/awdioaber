        "description": " Is the HIFIMAN Sundara Closed Back better than the original Sundara? Each model has its selling points. The Closed Back seems to be unveiled, but it lacks some low-end grunt which can be easily remedied up to a point. So there is the tradeoff. Very good midrange definition. Excellent isolation levels and very little bleed. Beautiful Beechwood cups",
