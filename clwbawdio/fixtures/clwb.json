        "description": "FiiO has focused on improving the sound quality this time around since there seems to be some features on previous models now removed. So, you lose a bass boost feature plus a line input which is a type of connectivity that’s losing popularity nowadays but, in its place, you get an upgraded and refined tuning. Neutral and natural sounding, plenty of driving power and a long battery life.",

Considering its input flexibility, clean implementation of the AKAK4493S dac, and good dynamics, this could be a perfect upgrade or starter DAC for audiophiles assembling their first desktop audio stack. Good dynamics, small footprint and native MQA unfolding.",

        "description": "I don’t usually associate the word analog or vintage with IEMs but Thieaudio proved it can be done in the form of the Elixir. Listeners can expect a clever negotiation of tonal balance between the usual V-shaped and neutral presentation without upsetting either use case. Achieves balance between flavor and resolution. Trims the shout off sharp gears without losing transparency. Genuine burl wood adds character and uniqueness.",
