        "title": "Can Power Cords Have an Effect on an Audio System’s Sound?",
        "description": "Steven Stone looks at two divergent views on power cords…",
        "text": "Cable discussions can turn normally rational audiophiles into nut-cases. I know. 
        I’ve been reading and watching the discussions since I wired up my first stereo system. 
        Recently I decided to ask two industry participants their take on power cords. 
        My question was, “How can a basic stock AC power cable negatively affect audio gear?” 
        Here are two divergent viewpoints…
        From Tommy O’Brien, (Digital Amplifier Company).
        The most important feature of a power cord for amplifiers is simple resistance. Other factors such as capacitance, 
        inductance, and shielding, are “in the noise” and not significant enough to affect 
        the sound of even the most revealing audio systems.",

        "title": "Ideal Room Size Dimensions and Ratios for Audiophile Listening",
        "description": "Dennis Foley discusses the idea of ideal room dimensions — and how important speakers are in the equation.",
        "text": "In this article, we’re going to talk about the ideal room sizes and dimensions. This is such 
        an important issue because nearly everybody gets it wrong, and if you get it wrong in the beginning, 
        getting good sound in that room is always going to be a struggle. How do we determine what size room 
        to build? Using a room that’s available is not necessarily the right answer. First, we have to determine 
        usage. We have to decide what we are going to do musically in this room. Is it two-channel playback? Is 
        it home theater? Is it a control room? Is it a listening room? Because each usage dictates energy requirements 
        and how large a room it should be. Each usage dictates the treatment that we’re going to put inside the room. 
        So the first thing we have to define is the usage. Speaker size to room size. Let’s take the example of room 
        usage. Let’s do two-channel playback because that’s a popular one. Okay, so what are we going to do for room 
        size and volume with two-channel playback? First question we need to answer is how much energy are we going 
        to put in the room? How do we determine that? How big are our speakers? We need to match the room size that 
        we have available, that we’re considering, to the speaker size. Are we going to put a 7-foot-tall speaker in 
        an 8-foot tall room? No, we want to put a smaller speaker in an 8-foot-tall room because 8 feet is a really 
        bad room dimension for acoustics but it’s the standard distance that we have here in North America. We have 
        to be very, very careful about matching the amount of energy placed in the room to the room size and volume. 
        Are we going to put a speaker with a 12-inch low-frequency driver in a room of 1,500 cubic feet? We do if we want 
        to have so much low frequency energy that it will drive us out of the room. If we figure out what those ratios 
        are, what the speaker size and the room volume and size need to be, then we can figure out the actual room height, 
        width and length we need.",
