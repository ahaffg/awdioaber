        "title": "Can Power Cords Have an Effect on an Audio System’s Sound?",
        "description": "Steven Stone looks at two divergent views on power cords…",
        "text": "Cable discussions can turn normally rational audiophiles into nut-cases. I know. 
        I’ve been reading and watching the discussions since I wired up my first stereo system. 
        Recently I decided to ask two industry participants their take on power cords. 
        My question was, “How can a basic stock AC power cable negatively affect audio gear?” 
        Here are two divergent viewpoints…
        From Tommy O’Brien, (Digital Amplifier Company).
        The most important feature of a power cord for amplifiers is simple resistance. Other factors such as capacitance, 
        inductance, and shielding, are “in the noise” and not significant enough to affect 
        the sound of even the most revealing audio systems.",

        "title": "Ideal Room Size Dimensions and Ratios for Audiophile Listening",
        "description": "Dennis Foley discusses the idea of ideal room dimensions — and how important speakers are in the equation.",
        "text": "In this article, we’re going to talk about the ideal room sizes and dimensions. This is such 
        an important issue because nearly everybody gets it wrong, and if you get it wrong in the beginning, 
        getting good sound in that room is always going to be a struggle. How do we determine what size room 
        to build? Using a room that’s available is not necessarily the right answer. First, we have to determine 
        usage. We have to decide what we are going to do musically in this room. Is it two-channel playback? Is 
        it home theater? Is it a control room? Is it a listening room? Because each usage dictates energy requirements 
        and how large a room it should be. Each usage dictates the treatment that we’re going to put inside the room. 
        So the first thing we have to define is the usage. Speaker size to room size. Let’s take the example of room 
        usage. Let’s do two-channel playback because that’s a popular one. Okay, so what are we going to do for room 
        size and volume with two-channel playback? First question we need to answer is how much energy are we going 
        to put in the room? How do we determine that? How big are our speakers? We need to match the room size that 
        we have available, that we’re considering, to the speaker size. Are we going to put a 7-foot-tall speaker in 
        an 8-foot tall room? No, we want to put a smaller speaker in an 8-foot-tall room because 8 feet is a really 
        bad room dimension for acoustics but it’s the standard distance that we have here in North America. We have 
        to be very, very careful about matching the amount of energy placed in the room to the room size and volume. 
        Are we going to put a speaker with a 12-inch low-frequency driver in a room of 1,500 cubic feet? We do if we want 
        to have so much low frequency energy that it will drive us out of the room. If we figure out what those ratios 
        are, what the speaker size and the room volume and size need to be, then we can figure out the actual room height, 
        width and length we need. Let’s take a standard size speaker that’s 4 feet tall. It’s a good size speaker to 
        work with — and quite honestly, you really don’t need anything larger in any size room but that’s a discussion 
        for another time. The bottom line here is once we have matched the speaker to the room size and volume, 
        then we can ask how much distance we need for the energy the speaker produces inside the room so we have 
        fewer acoustical issues. The way we reduce the number of acoustical issues is by managing sound pressure and 
        reflections. We need space to do that. To summarize: You must match the size and energy-producing capability 
        of your speakers to the room size and volume, then you must minimize the low-frequency pressure issues in the 
        room, and then you must manage the sound reflections. All of this depends on gear, room size and room volume. 
        There are no easy answers, but there are many options and possibilities.",

    "title": "With Headphones and Shoes the Fit is More Important Than Anything Else",
    "description": "Steven Stone looks at why an under £300 headphone can be better than a £1000 one…",
    "text": "Last week, on a Facebook group page dedicated to headphones someone posted a query about which 
    pair of premium headphones the group would recommend they purchase. The responses were as expected, with 
    partisans of one or another of the models listed singing their praises and indicating that they would be 
    the best choice. I, of course, disagreed with all these recommendations. My suggestion was, “Try each one 
    on for fifteen minutes. You will then know which one to buy.” Notice that I did not say, “Listen to each 
    one for fifteen minutes…” Most likely the prospective owner will be listening during their “try-on time” 
    so in some way considering the sound is a given. But if two headphones have the same approximate level of 
    sound quality, any sane audiophile is going to choose the one that is more comfortable at the end of the 
    listening session. It’s important to wait at least a full fifteen minutes of on-head time. Why? Because 
    some headphones that feel OK when you first put them on your head (or into your ear canals if they are 
    in-ears) can become oppressive by the end of fifteen minutes. You need to know this before you make the 
    mistake of buying them. Over the course of the last five years I’ve reviewed a wide variety of earphones, 
    some priced under $20 and some approaching five figures when you add in the headphone amplifier. While 
    I’m sure I would be thoroughly chastised by commenters if I claimed there are under $100 headphones that 
    are “better” than $1000 ones, but I have experienced $300 headphones that I preferred using to several 
    multi-thousand dollar ones I’ve reviewed. And yes, in every case it was the fit that made the less 
    expensive headphones a better option for me. Head sizes and shapes are as variable and idiosyncratic as 
    feet, and as someone who appreciates finely-made footwear, I am quite familiar with what a good fit feels 
    like as well as what one that is not quite right can do to you during the course of a day. Just as one 
    company’s 9 1/2 B sized shoe is not necessarily the same size as another company’s 9 ½ B, a headphone 
    that “fits most heads perfectly” could very well not fit your head optimally. With shoes whether the fit is 
    right can be pretty obvious, sometimes with headphones it takes a bit longer. All the on-line and mail-order 
    shoe outlets have liberal “return if not satisfied” policies, headphone sales sites need to be equally
    liberal. Let me clarify one last thing before we part company – I am not saying that sound quality does not
    matter, it certainly does; but that in the long run how a pair of headphones or earphones fit is going to
    have a greater bearing on how much you use and enjoy them than their sound quality alone, no matter how
    stellar that sound quality may be.",
