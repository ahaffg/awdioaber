        "description": "Steven Stone looks at two divergent views on power cords…",
        "text": "Cable discussions can turn normally rational audiophiles into nut-cases. I know. 
        I’ve been reading and watching the discussions since I wired up my first stereo system. 
        Recently I decided to ask two industry participants their take on power cords. 
        My question was, “How can a basic stock AC power cable negatively affect audio gear?” 
        Here are two divergent viewpoints…
        From Tommy O’Brien, (Digital Amplifier Company).
        The most important feature of a power cord for amplifiers is simple resistance. Other factors such as capacitance, 
        inductance, and shielding, are “in the noise” and not significant enough to affect 
        the sound of even the most revealing audio systems.",

        "title": "Ideal Room Size Dimensions and Ratios for Audiophile Listening",
        "description": "Dennis Foley discusses the idea of ideal room dimensions — and how important speakers are in the equation.",
        "text": "In this article, we’re going to talk about the ideal room sizes and dimensions. This is such 
        an important issue because nearly everybody gets it wrong, and if you get it wrong in the beginning, 
        getting good sound in that room is always going to be a struggle. How do we determine what size room 
        to build? Using a room that’s available is not necessarily the right answer. First, we have to determine 
        usage. We have to decide what we are going to do musically in this room. Is it two-channel playback? Is 
        it home theater? Is it a control room? Is it a listening room? Because each usage dictates energy requirements 
        and how large a room it should be. Each usage dictates the treatment that we’re going to put inside the room. 
        So the first thing we have to define is the usage. Speaker size to room size. Let’s take the example of room 
        usage. Let’s do two-channel playback because that’s a popular one. Okay, so what are we going to do for room 
        size and volume with two-channel playback? First question we need to answer is how much energy are we going 
        to put in the room? How do we determine that? How big are our speakers? We need to match the room size that 
        we have available, that we’re considering, to the speaker size. Are we going to put a 7-foot-tall speaker in 
        an 8-foot tall room? No, we want to put a smaller speaker in an 8-foot-tall room because 8 feet is a really 
        bad room dimension for acoustics but it’s the standard distance that we have here in North America. We have 
        to be very, very careful about matching the amount of energy placed in the room to the room size and volume. 
        Are we going to put a speaker with a 12-inch low-frequency driver in a room of 1,500 cubic feet? We do if we want 
        to have so much low frequency energy that it will drive us out of the room. If we figure out what those ratios 
        are, what the speaker size and the room volume and size need to be, then we can figure out the actual room height, 
        width and length we need. Let’s take a standard size speaker that’s 4 feet tall. It’s a good size speaker to 
        work with — and quite honestly, you really don’t need anything larger in any size room but that’s a discussion 
        for another time. The bottom line here is once we have matched the speaker to the room size and volume, 
        then we can ask how much distance we need for the energy the speaker produces inside the room so we have 
        fewer acoustical issues. The way we reduce the number of acoustical issues is by managing sound pressure and 
        reflections. We need space to do that. To summarize: You must match the size and energy-producing capability 
        of your speakers to the room size and volume, then you must minimize the low-frequency pressure issues in the 
        room, and then you must manage the sound reflections. All of this depends on gear, room size and room volume. 
        There are no easy answers, but there are many options and possibilities.",

    "title": "With Headphones and Shoes the Fit is More Important Than Anything Else",
    "description": "Steven Stone looks at why an under £300 headphone can be better than a £1000 one…",
    "text": "Last week, on a Facebook group page dedicated to headphones someone posted a query about which 
    pair of premium headphones the group would recommend they purchase. The responses were as expected, with 
    partisans of one or another of the models listed singing their praises and indicating that they would be 
    the best choice. I, of course, disagreed with all these recommendations. My suggestion was, “Try each one 
    on for fifteen minutes. You will then know which one to buy.” Notice that I did not say, “Listen to each 
    one for fifteen minutes…” Most likely the prospective owner will be listening during their “try-on time” 
    so in some way considering the sound is a given. But if two headphones have the same approximate level of 
    sound quality, any sane audiophile is going to choose the one that is more comfortable at the end of the 
    listening session. It’s important to wait at least a full fifteen minutes of on-head time. Why? Because 
    some headphones that feel OK when you first put them on your head (or into your ear canals if they are 
    in-ears) can become oppressive by the end of fifteen minutes. You need to know this before you make the 
    mistake of buying them. Over the course of the last five years I’ve reviewed a wide variety of earphones, 
    some priced under $20 and some approaching five figures when you add in the headphone amplifier. While 
    I’m sure I would be thoroughly chastised by commenters if I claimed there are under $100 headphones that 
    are “better” than $1000 ones, but I have experienced $300 headphones that I preferred using to several 
    multi-thousand dollar ones I’ve reviewed. And yes, in every case it was the fit that made the less 
    expensive headphones a better option for me. Head sizes and shapes are as variable and idiosyncratic as 
    feet, and as someone who appreciates finely-made footwear, I am quite familiar with what a good fit feels 
    like as well as what one that is not quite right can do to you during the course of a day. Just as one 
    company’s 9 1/2 B sized shoe is not necessarily the same size as another company’s 9 ½ B, a headphone 
    that “fits most heads perfectly” could very well not fit your head optimally. With shoes whether the fit is 
    right can be pretty obvious, sometimes with headphones it takes a bit longer. All the on-line and mail-order 
    shoe outlets have liberal “return if not satisfied” policies, headphone sales sites need to be equally
    liberal. Let me clarify one last thing before we part company – I am not saying that sound quality does not
    matter, it certainly does; but that in the long run how a pair of headphones or earphones fit is going to
    have a greater bearing on how much you use and enjoy them than their sound quality alone, no matter how
    stellar that sound quality may be.",

        "title": "Expensive or Inexpensive Portable Audio for You and Me?",
        "description": "Steven Stone looks at what is and is not affordable when it comes to portable audio…It’s the time of year for saving money!",
        "text": "Several years ago, I was in the middle of a multi-leg travel jaunt when I realized I had left 
        my in-ears in the previous airplane’s seat crevice. Faced with a future of a five-hour flight without 
        music or any way to keep sane I opted to purchase a replacement pair in one of the airline shops that 
        specialize in earphones and portable gadgets. The pair I had lost were Shure 500-series in-ears. To 
        replace them cost me full boat, list price, which was somewhere around $500+. So, in essence I had 
        just burned up half a grand making myself whole again… The experience got me thinking about what I 
        considered “affordable” when it came to portable audio. Depending on the publication I’m writing for, 
        “affordable” can have a wide range of numerics attached. For The Absolute Sound, anything under £1000 
        seems to qualify as affordable. Conversely, one of the Facebooks groups I frequent “Cheap Earphones” 
        would consider anything over £100 too expensive. But where do I stand on affordability? So, in the 
        end I think that affordability will always be a personal rather than universal yardstick. Elon Musk 
        could probably, if he wanted, go out for a walk with a pair of those $120,000 bejeweled Focal Utopia’s, 
        while I would be too nervous to have them in my domicile for even one day…but I’m comfortable with 
        using the Sonoma Model One headphone system at home, sometimes in preference to a room-based transducer. 
        On the street I prefer to carry more easily-replaceable gear. So, what is your personal affordability 
        comfort level? For me the good news is that there are inexpensive portable audio options that work well 
        and if they are lost, stolen, or damaged, easily replaced. Yeseree…inexpensive audio gear has an 
        important place in my world… For me, it’s personal. By this I mean that “affordability” has a sliding 
        scale depending on where and when I plan to use a “portable” product. I have completely different personal 
        affordability levels for gear that I will use primarily out in the world verses gear that never leaves 
        my listening room. Why? Because the gear I take out into the street has a far greater probability of 
        being lost, stolen, or broken than anything that never goes out the front door. ",

        "title": "Four Headphone Stands – All under $50",
        "description": "Steven Stone gives his recommendations for inexpensive headphone stands that work…It’s 
        the time of year for saving money!",
        "text": "There is a point in every headphone using audiophile’s life when they will find that the need a 
        headphone stand. For some it will be after they buy their second pair full-sized headphones. For others 
        it won’t be until every spare surface area on their desk is filled with headphones. But whenever you 
        decide to take the plunge, rest assured that you have a myriad of options from cheap to very pricy. My 
        bias is simple – I am not a big fan of expensive headphone stands. But from my own research it’s obvious 
        that with headphone stands the least expensive options can have some drawbacks, but they can offer a way 
        to get all your headphones off your desk without requiring you take out a 30-year loan. The least 
        expensive “headphone stand” I have in my collection isn’t a stand at all and wasn’t even created 
        for use with headphones. It’s a banana hanger. For you £8 you get a plastic hook that can attach 
        to any shelf. I have 16 of them, all occupied. The disadvantage to these is that they can leave a 
        crease on a padded headband, so the trick is to move the phones every couple of days so that they 
        are resting on a different part of the padded band. If you actually use all the headphones you’ve 
        got on these hangers this should not be a problem. For £10 you can get “the Anchor” from Elevation 
        labs. This headphone holder was designed to go under a desktop and had a larger area for the headband 
        than the banana stands. The only problem is the hanger does not have holes for screws but instead 
        relies on 3M sticky take to adhere to the underside of your desktop. I would recommend drilling a 
        couple of holes and mounting it with a pair of screws for maximum adherence. My current favorite 
        cheap desktop headphone stand will set you back $17. Made and sold by Jackcube design through 
        Amazon, this padded stand even has a place for you to coil your cables on its back side. I’ve yet 
        to find a pair of full-sized headphones that don’t fit comfortably on it. Also the stand is tall 
        enough that even the new Sony flagship headphones, the MDR-Z1s, which have rather long ferules 
        on its detachable cable, rest comfortably without stressing the cable connections. Finally, the 
        large base makes it more stable than many stands. My final suggestion for an inexpensive headphone 
        stand comes from Massdrop. Their Just Mobile stand is usually £40 but they have it down to £27. 
        It’s tall enough so that cables don’t get stressed and has a nice clean modern look. My only 
        reservation is that with some padded headbands the stand could leave an indentation, but only if 
        the headphones sit in the same position for a while. So, use ’em… Obviously, there are far more 
        expensive stands such as the £600 Klutz Design Can Cans which is a lovely and well-thought-out design 
        that’s perfect for your Focal Utopias. But thrifty audiophiles don’t use stands that cost more 
        than their cans. Another stand, that is more affordable, but still above the $50 limit is from Oppo. 
        It’s £80 and features a clear plexi top coupled with a wood base. For audiophiles who like to DIY, 
        I’ve seen headphone stands made of white plastic plumbing parts that had a neat steampunk vibe. 
        The important things to look for in any stand, whether you make it yourself, buy an inexpensive 
        one, or go for a premium-priced model, is whether it is stable and not likely to tip over, tall 
        enough so your cables aren’t stressed, and won’t crease or deform your headband cushion. If your 
        stand does all these things well, then you have a winner…",

        "title": "Do We All REALLY Hear Things Differently?",
        "description": "Brent Butterworth reports on a recent study about the variability of audio judgments.",
        "text": "I’ve heard or read a zillion times the maxim, “Everybody hears differently.” I’ve heard it 
        while chatting with enthusiasts and manufacturers at audio shows. I’ve read it on audio forums and in 
        the online comments after audio reviews, usually slung to cast doubt on someone else’s judgment about 
        an audio technology or product. I’ve even said somewhat similar (although much more factually supported) 
        things myself, especially in an article titled “5 Reasons Why Headphones Can Sound Different to Different 
        People.” But a recent research project, conducted by one of the most respected teams of scientists in the 
        audio biz, suggests that maybe we don’t hear things all that differently — and that maybe we can make some 
        universal judgments about audio gear. The project is summed up in a paper titled “The Influence of 
        Listeners’ Experience, Age and Culture on Headphone Sound Quality Preferences,” by Sean Olive, 
        Todd Welti and Elisabeth McMullin, all researchers currently working at Harman International. 
        (Left to right, that’s Welti, Olive and McMullin in the picture.) For this project, the team had 
        a wide variety of listeners assess the sound quality of four different headphones: The test subjects 
        included trained and untrained listeners; listeners in Canada, China, Germany and the United States; 
        and listeners ranging from under 25 to over 55 years old. OK, so we all know the poor Beats Studio was 
        thrown in to give the listeners a headphone that sounds radically different from and clearly inferior 
        to the others. This is a common technique in multiproduct comparisons to make the listeners more 
        comfortable with their judgments. If you can hear one right away that you don’t like, you’re a lot 
        more comfortable with the test and more confident in your assessments. After throwing out the Beats 
        Studio, though, it’d be reasonable to expect that listeners’ judgments of the headphones would vary. 
        The Audeze and Sennheiser models are well-regaded audiophile headphones, and the Harman Curve model 
        uses a response curve derived through what is surely the most extensive research program ever 
        conducted into headphone sound. But no: With few exceptions, the listeners tended to rank the headphones 
        in the same order no matter their age, country of residence or listening experience.
        Here are two of the group’s three key conclusions:
        1) “Listeners generally preferred the same headphones regardless of their listening experience, 
        country of residence, or age.”
        2) “The more preferred headphones tended to have a measured response that was smoother, more 
        extended in bandwidth and had a bass lift to simulate an accurate loudspeaker calibrated in a listening room.”
        There were a few variances worth noting. The quality rankings weren’t as consistent among untrained 
        listeners as they were among trained listeners. Listeners over 55 ranked the overall 2nd-place headphone 
        slightly higher than the overall 1st-place headphone. But as you go through the charts presented on the 
        free PDF of the presentation (available on this page), it’s remarkable how consistent the results were.
        (Being scientists, the group didn’t want to slag any particular brand, so they didn’t say how the 
        headphones ranked. But they did present the frequency response measurements of the headphones, and 
        judging from my own measurements it looks like the Harman Curve headphone won, followed by the 
        Sennheiser, the Audeze and the Beats.) Of course, this is just one study employing four headphones 
        and three pieces of music, so it doesn’t prove anything. But it does cast doubt on the idea that all 
        judgments about audio are completely subjective.",

        "description": "Steven Stone looks at headphones yearly sales growth that shows that humans 
        like sticking wireless stuff into their ears…",
        "text": "Yesterday I received the latest sales figures for headphones from the most excellent 
        researchers at Futuresource Consulting. They found revenues from headphones had, in their words, 
        “surged” 26% in the last quarter, Q3. So far for the year, headphones sales have accounted for 
        $5.5US billion worldwide. In his report Futuresource Consulting research analyst Luke Pearce 
        found, “All this activity is the result of consumers demanding more features, as they seek to 
        upgrade & spend money on products for new emerging use cases in the aftermarket for headphones. 
        Within in-ear, wireless and true wireless headphones are drawing the crowds. For the over-ear segment, 
        sales are being fueled by demand for wireless too, but combine this with noise-cancelling technology 
        and your product could be high on a consumer’s wish list. Sales of Bose’s QC 35 II, still performing 
        well even after a year of sales… Luke Pearce also includes this interesting fact, “Shipments of 
        true wireless headphones doubled in volume year-on-year, while revenues for this category grew to 
        within striking distance of $1 billion…One in every ten sets of true wireless headphones sold in the 
        quarter were marketed for sports.” It’s obvious that the reason for this explosion of growth in 
        wireless headsets of all kinds stems from the simple fact that wireless headsets are far more 
        ergonomically elegant than wired ones. And most humans would prefer, if given the choice, wireless 
        headphones. It also indicates that utility, not sound quality, is the primary reason for wireless 
        headphones purchase. For audiophiles there is plenty of good news on the wireless headphone front – 
        the latest generation of premium smart phones and portable players are supporting the higher-level 
        Bluetooth codecs so when connected to a headphone that also supports higher resolution codecs the 
        results are, in some cases, sonically on par with a wired headphone. Bluetooth wireless headphones 
        can be musically involving and are certainly worthy of an audiophile’s attention. ” Jerry Del Colliano 
        reviewed the Bose QC35 for Home Theater Review, and I covered them for another publication. We both 
        agreed that their ergonomics, noise cancelling, battery life, fit, and design was first rate. The only 
        thing they lacked was anything above mediocre, polite sound. So far, the only Bluetooth/wireless headphones 
        I’ve heard that you can begin to take seriously from a sonics point of view are those equipped with 
        Bluetooth 4.2 and either aptX HD or Sony’s LDAC protocols. When it comes to wireless headphones, 
        sound quality is a feature that only comes into play when the devices move into price ranges where 
        they have already exhausted more in-demand ergonomic features. If you look at “smart speakers” you 
        see the same trends – people are buying smart speakers not due to their sound quality, but their 
        ergonomics. The irony, from an audiophile point of view, is that according to Digital Music News 
        smart speakers’ primary function is playing music. According to Deloitte Global Consumer Survey 
        respondents between the age of 18 and 75 years use their smart speakers to play music 60% of the 
        time. Also, according to the study, “smart speakers will be a $7 billion business by the end of 2019. 
        That’s a 63 percent jump over 2018 projected revenues of $4.3 billion, and just one of several bullish 
        projections for smart speakers.” An article released recently on Fast Company states, “…most of the 
        smart speakers sold cost far less than the HomePod. Smart speakers with prices between $200 and $400 
        made up only 5% of unit sales.” This all reinforces what I’ve written in other blogs – except in 
        very rare cases audiophiles will not find smart speakers to be anything but mid-fi devices. When 
        you look at the sales numbers generated by wireless headphones and smart speakers, it’s easy to see 
        that improvements in the sound quality of devices destined for the vast majority of humans are not 
        going to improve drastically with the next wave of wireless earphones and smart speakers, except for 
        those willing to opt for premium-priced options. So, those engaged in the hobby of audiophilia can 
        rest assured that they will remain as marginalized in this new age of smart phones, streaming, and 
        wireless audio, as they have been throughout the history of consumer audio products…",

        room, and we could tell precisely, on a line drawn between our two stereo speakers, where each player of

        goes bad.  It all has to do with eating: For most non-sessile animals, it’s important to have two ears 
        because doing so allows them to exactly determine the location, movement, and velocity of something that 
        they might want to eat or that might want to eat them. 
        
        With two ears and sufficient “processing” capability (brain function, which even the lowest animals 
        have to a surprising degree) it’s possible, by hearing when the sound of something arrives at each ear; 
        at which ear it arrives first; and by how much time the two arrivals differ; to “place” things – in both 
        distance and direction — with an astonishing degree of precision and, thus, to find things to eat or to 
        get  warning of, and possibly avoid, things that are trying to eat you. 
        
        When we were omnivorous hunter-gatherers, that capability aided us tremendously, and may have been an 
        important factor in our species’ survival to this day. Now, though, we’re mostly free from predators, 
        and the things in grocery stores tend to be silent, giving us little clue of their whereabouts so we can 
        select them. That may be why we were forced, over time, to create locomotives, jet planes, The Dukes of 
        Dixieland, marching bands, music, and stereo systems to put our two ears to use. 
        
        AR-binaural1a.jpgIf you stop to think about it, most of sound is about time: When technically describing 
        it, two of the main things we talk or write about are amplitude (how LOUD it is) and frequency — for a 
        single tone, how many times a sinusoidal pressure wave (the elements of what we hear as sound) is repeated 
        each second (a purely timing function). Time is one of the absolute basics of sound, and so is phase, which 
        is, itself, a time function, with every sine wave consisting of 360 degrees of phase – each being 1/360th of 
        a wave-duration long. Thus, if the  speed of sound in air at sea-level is (at “normal” temperature and 
        pressure) considered to be 1,125 feet per second (343 m/sec) and we’re talking about a 1kHz (1,000 “cycles” 
        per second) sinewave, its wavelength will be 1.125ft (0.343m) (1,125ft÷ 1000 = 1.125 ft) or about 13.5 
        inches (34.29cm) and each degree of phase (180 degrees positive plus 180 degrees negative) will be 0.0375 
        inches (9.53mm) long. (13.5″ ÷ 360 = 0.0375″ or 34.29cm ÷ 360 = 0.0953 cm = 9.53mm). 
        
        Where all this becomes important is when you consider that the ear-to-ear distance through the average 
        head is something like 6 inches (15.24cm). For sound at 1kHz, that distance is equal to 160° of phase. 
        (6″÷ 0.0375″ = 160 or 15.24cm ÷ 0.0953cm = 160) which means that if a 1kHz tone were to arrive at your 
        left ear from a source directly facing that ear at (by some fortuitous happenstance) .a point on its 
        waveform corresponding to 0° of phase, by the time it traveled the additional 6 inches or 15.24 cm to 
        get to your right ear, it would be 0.0004444 seconds (0.4444 milliseconds) later (6″= 0.5′,  0.5’÷ 1125′ 
        per second = 0.0004444 seconds)and 160° different in phase. And if, on the other hand, that 1kHz tone came 
        from directly in front of you, instead of even with your left ear and 90° directly to your side, both of 
        your ears would hear it at the same time and in the same phase. That’s how time and phase help us to tell 
        the direction and distance that sounds are coming from (and, of course, to locate the things, instruments, 
        or people that are making them). 
        
        AR-binaural4a.jpgIt’s also one of the reasons why binaural sound can be better than stereo. The earliest 
        two channel stereo (and what seems to be an increasing number of modern audiophile recordings, too) was 
        recorded with just two broadly-spaced (eight feet apart or thereabouts) omnidirectional microphones placed 
        directly above and/or in front of the performers.   With just one mic per channel and with the mics placed 
        (except for height) at about the same distance as the playback speakers would be, each mic became 
        functionally analogous to each of the ears of the ultimate listener, and one would expect that a reasonably 
        accurate stereo presentation could be produced. 
        
        The problem with it is that, even with that simple setup, both of the microphones can hear – except as 
        attenuated by distance — all of the sound coming from all of the players, instead of the left mic hearing 
        only the players on the left side and the right mic hearing only the players on the right.
        
        AR-binaural3a.jpg“Well, so what”, you might ask, “Don’t our ears do exactly the same thing?” And you might 
        even add something about the microphones and the speakers playing-back the sound recorded from them both 
        being (roughly) the same distance apart, so the time differences between (for example) the right-side sound 
        heard by the left mic and the right-side sound played-back by the left-side speaker (and vice versa) should 
        be the same for both mics and for both speakers.
        
        And that would be exactly right, except that the distance between our ears is only about 6 inches, instead 
        of the 8 feet – 16 times as much – between the two microphones or the two playback speakers, and that means 
        that the distance in time and in phase that will be recorded and played back by those microphones and speakers 
        – the auditory “parallax” (if I may coin a new term) – will be far greater than what we would hear if we 
        were listening to the same live performance with our own ears instead of a pair of microphones. And that 
        will mean that, no matter how good our system is, it can never really get the time and phase right, and 
        sound like live music. 
        
        With binaural recording, though, and playback through head phones, it’s easy. I’ll go into it in more detail 
        next time.
