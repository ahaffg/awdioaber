However, as we settle into the &lsquo;new normal&rsquo;, it&rsquo;s more important than ever to take care in carefully cleaning equipment such as the treadmill, cross trainer, rower and step machine before and after use.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Keep reading to learn more about how you can clean the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.puregym.com/blog/gym-machine-set-up/\">cardio machines at the gym</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>General cleaning of cardio machines</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each cardio machine will need to be cleaned in a slightly different way, but there are some universal tips to bear in mind, including:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Clean hands: wash or sanitise your hands as regularly as possible while at the gym, including when you arrive. At PureGym you&rsquo;ll be able to make use of the many sanitisation stations we&rsquo;ll provide around the gym.</li>\r\n\t<li>Clean machines before and after use: this will ensure your exercise area is ready for you before you start and also clean for whoever comes next. All gym members will be encouraged to do the same.</li>\r\n\t<li>Use antiviral wipes or sprayed paper towels: give the machines a clean down with either a folded paper towel, spritzed at least twice with cleaning spray, or with sanitising wipes. We&rsquo;ll be ensuring plenty of both are available around the gym. Don&rsquo;t spray cleaning fluid directly onto the machinery as it could push anything sitting on the surface into the air.</li>\r\n\t<li>Don&rsquo;t use a sweat towel: stick to using the cleaning products and towels provided by the gyms rather than bringing your own gym/sweat towel; this will help to limit the spread of germs from outside the gym.</li>\r\n\t<li>Be careful around screens and electrics: While it&rsquo;s important to wipe these down if you&rsquo;re touching them, don&rsquo;t let screens get too damp.</li>\r\n\t<li>Focus on cleaning the main touch points of equipment: including any handles, seats, adjustment points, buttons you may press and so on.</li>\r\n\t<li>Clean under your phone and water bottle: if you rested any of your own belongings on the equipment, or the water bottle holder, make sure to give these areas a wipe over.</li>\r\n\t<li>But don&rsquo;t forget the rest: as a courtesy, also give the parts of the equipment directly in front of you a wipe down when you&rsquo;re finished too &ndash; you&rsquo;ll be breathing heavily over these areas during your workout.</li>\r\n\t<li>Wait a few seconds after wiping down: the cleaning liquid will need a few moments to work and dry, so please wait 20 to 30 seconds before using so the surfaces aren&rsquo;t slippery for use.</li>\r\n\t<li>Bin cloths and wipes: put these in the bins provided &ndash; don&rsquo;t leave any used tissues on the gym floor or on the equipment.</li>\r\n\t<li>Try not to touch afterwards: when wiping down the equipment after use, try not to place your hands on the cleaned areas.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How to clean a treadmill</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>While&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.puregym.com/blog/10-reasons-why-you-should-use-a-treadmill/\">exercising on the treadmill</a>&nbsp;focuses mostly on your footwork as you walk or run, there are also several touch points you&rsquo;ll need to consider when cleaning it down.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Wipe down the full length of the side grip handles, both on top and underneath</li>\r\n\t<li>Ensure you also wipe over the entire front display, but with a lighter pressure on the display screen</li>\r\n\t<li>Focus in particular on any buttons you will be or have pressed</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How to clean the cross trainer</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Again, while the focus may be on your legs while using the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.puregym.com/blog/6-reasons-why-you-should-start-using-a-cross-trainer/\">cross trainer</a>, there are also several areas you&rsquo;ll be touching and handling as you work out.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Wipe over the entirety of both the moving and static handles, taking care to wipe all sides and over the top end</li>\r\n\t<li>Clean over the front display, paying particular attention to any buttons you may have pressed when turning on or adjusting the incline etc.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How to clean the step machine</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Paying careful attention to which parts of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.puregym.com/blog/stepping-up-to-fitness/\">step machine</a>&nbsp;you&rsquo;ve made contact with will help you ensure a thorough clean.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Take particular note of any handles or support bars you touched or used while working out or getting on to the step machine and make sure you&rsquo;ve cleaned them thoroughly</li>\r\n\t<li>Wipe over the whole of the display screen, paying particular attention to the buttons you&rsquo;ve pressed while adjusting the settings</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>With a little consideration for cleanliness, we can dramatically reduce the risks faced from Covid-19 and other viruses, and create a safer space for all our members.&nbsp;</p>", "thumbnail": "trainsafe_cleaning_blogheader-5.jpg", "publish_date": "2020-08-08T15:09:41.086Z", "last_updated": "2020-08-08T15:09:41.086Z", "author": 2, "slug": "how-to-clean-cardio-machines", "featured": false}}, {"model": "blog.blog", "pk": 2, "fields": {"title": "HOW TO SUPPORT YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM", "category": "Dieting", "content": "<p>It seems that there&rsquo;s one word which is quite literally on everyone&rsquo;s lips at the moment. The coronavirus or Covid-19 has instilled new meaning to the term &ldquo;going viral&rdquo; and the World Health Organisation has finally classified the global spread of this new kid on the block as a pandemic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Remove the middle three letters from this word and ironically, you&rsquo;re left with &ldquo;panic&rdquo; which is perhaps the most immediate and obvious side-effect of the outbreak so far. Uncertainty is the oxygen that fuels this. Which is why we want to make sure that we provide our members with accurate up to date advice and guidance. And what we&rsquo;re hearing is that you want to know how best to protect yourselves and your loved ones.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We spoke with&nbsp;<em>Dr. Sarah Hattam</em>, who has supported us over the years in creating evidence backed content about wellbeing and health. Dr. Sarah has 25 years&rsquo; experience and is on a mission to fight the pseudo-science in the industry. She is passionate about sharing information that is backed by the latest science and research about how our human bodies and brains really thrive. This is what she had to say:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First and foremost, it&rsquo;s critical that we all follow the government&rsquo;s advice which you can find&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"UK GOV\">here</a>&nbsp;if you&#39;re living in the UK. Please make sure to follow the guidelines to help reduce the spread of the virus and help to flatten the curve.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most crucial advice is to wash hands frequently with soap and hot water for 30 seconds or 60% alcohol hand sanitiser if this isn&rsquo;t available.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To always wash hands thoroughly before eating.&nbsp; But we were doing this before anyway right? To avoid touching the face, mouth and eyes and to treat your mobile phone like a third hand, wiping it over with alcohol wipes regularly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As with any infection, our bodies have an army of immune cells ready to be deployed to wage war against such bugs. Our immune response is an incredible, but also complex system &ndash; that can become suppressed (weakened) as a result of some of our day to day habits. It is important to note is that there is no magic pill or solution to &lsquo;boost&rsquo; your immune system, and because of the way our immune system is designed to work you really don&rsquo;t want it to be &lsquo;boosted&rsquo;. But there are some simple steps you can take to help support your immune response - giving your immune system the best chance to fight coronavirus quickly and effectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>SLEEP ON IT</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A lack of sleep is one of the main contributors that can reduce the effectiveness of your immune system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Studies show that people who don&#39;t get quality sleep or enough sleep are more likely to get sick after being exposed to a virus [1].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not enough sleep can also affect how quickly you recover if you do get sick, as our white blood cells (also known as the body&rsquo;s natural killer cells) become less effective when we are sleep deprived. But we understand that it&rsquo;s not quite as easy as just saying &lsquo;get more sleep&rsquo;. Some simple tips to improve sleep quality are to ditch the devices before bed, avoid caffeine after mid-afternoon and remember to give yourself time to unwind from the day. A clear mind not only can help you drift off into dream land quicker, but also helps you reach the deep phase of sleep which is where the most restorative sleep happens.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>KEEP MOVING</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Just like a healthy diet, exercise contributes to good health, and subsequently a healthy immune system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Research shows that adults who are physically active are almost half as likely to succumb to minor infections in comparison to sedentary adults [2].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One reason for this is thought to be because exercise promotes good circulation. Good Circulation allows immune cells to move through your bloodstream and do their job more efficiently, meaning more effective scanning and action to deal with disease-causing bugs.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>DON&#39;T FORGET VITAMIN D</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Generally, a lot of emphasis is put on Vitamin A, C and E and their role in immune function. But it&rsquo;s important to not forget Vitamin D. Not only does it play an essential role in supporting healthy bones but has also been recognised as supporting our immune system. Specifically, the immune response to viral infections. However, unsurprisingly 29% of adults have insufficient levels of vitamin D in the winter months [3]. This so-called sunshine vitamin is only manufactured in our body when sunlight hits our skin, making it common for us to be under the recommended 10ug per day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Therefore, it&rsquo;s recommended that you include vitamin D rich food sources within your diet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Foods such as oily fish, eggs and fortified cereals can help to increase vitamin D levels. But vitamin D supplements are also a good, cost-effective option which have even been shown to reduce respiratory infections and improve asthma control [4].</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>DIAL DOWN STRESS</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Easy for us to say, right?&nbsp; 21st&nbsp;century life is full on; we&rsquo;re juggling competing demands and the incessant news chatter about the current pandemic isn&rsquo;t exactly helping the situation. But we know that persistent stress and the subsequent release of stress hormones in our blood stream can damp down our immune system&rsquo;s ability to respond effectively to infections [5].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, don&rsquo;t forget to keep doing the things that bring you joy, and remember to&nbsp;take a mindful moment or two during a busy day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All of these things allow our &ldquo;tend and mend&rdquo; system to be switched on which has many beneficial effects for health&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>BE SENSIBLE ABOUT SUPPLEMENTS</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Lots of dietary supplements claim to have immune boosting properties. But what does the science actually say? The NHS website says that there is little evidence that supplements such as vitamin C, echinacea or garlic either prevent viral infections or speed up recovery. It&rsquo;s important to remember that most of us can meet our RDA nutrient needs with a varied, balanced diet. So, when it comes to supplements, you could be wasting your money if expensive products make extravagant claims. Remember, if something sounds too good to be true, it usually is!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>EAT SMART</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Like any effective army, our immune system fights on its stomach. So, the best and most effective way to fuel a healthy immune system is by eating an abundant variety of fresh fruit and vegetables.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eating a rainbow of different coloured fruit and veg will give your body a range of phytonutrients and micronutrients to improve its defences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And the good guys in your gut, the health-giving bacteria that make up our microbiome will thank you for ever because you&rsquo;ll be feeding them too.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>WHEN TO EAT</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>As we get older, our immune system becomes less effective at fighting off potentially harmful invaders. Allowing your digestive system to have a whole 12-hour break from food overnight can keep our digestive system healthy, allow cells to repair themselves and keep our immune system strong.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>WATCH THE BOOZE</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Studies show that alcohol weakens our immune system [6] and can also disrupt quality sleep and tends to drive us towards unhealthier food decisions. So, there are lots of reasons why it could be sensible to cut right back or even avoid it altogether.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, keep on making healthy lifestyle choices because they will help you to keep your immune system tip-top and aid your recovery if you do get sick.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong>&nbsp;None of the above is intended to be medical advice.

What is it? In simple terms, I like to define it as full body exercises based around movements and activities you do every day and which work through multiple plains. These can be replicated in the gym, with or without added weight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Functional exercises includes&nbsp;movements such as:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Squatting</li>\r\n\t<li>Lunging</li>\r\n\t<li>Pushing</li>\r\n\t<li>Pulling</li>\r\n\t<li>Twisting</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Incorporating functional exercises into your standard routine allows the entire body to work together to produce optimal movements. There are many benefits of adding functional training exercises to your workouts including: improved balance, better posture and coordination, increased strength, and decreased chance of injury. Tt is important that we include these into our routine, particularly as we age, so that we can stay mobile and to perform everyday activities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>If you want to improve your ability to perform everyday tasks, build overall strength and balance, and develop your resistance to injury then the following exercises are must-haves.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>1. DEADLIFT</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Purpose:</strong>&nbsp;This move will help strengthen all your whole body, particularly the pull muscles required to perform this movement, including your back, quads, glutes, and hamstrings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Real-life applicaiton:</strong>&nbsp;The deadlift works every muscle to perform an essential movement - picking something up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How do deadlift:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>To perform the deadlift correctly, start by getting your foot position correct. The easiest way to do that is to start in your normal standing position, jump up and down a couple of times and your natural landing position is your ideal deadlift stance.</li>\r\n\t<li>Stand close to the bar with your shins approximately 2 fingers width away from the bar and your shins as vertical as possible.</li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"https://www.puregym.com/blog/5-functional-exercises-you-should-include-in-your-training/#anchor-1\">Hip hinge</a>&nbsp;and reach down to touch the bar&nbsp;just wider than the leg width. You can&nbsp;either use a double overhand grip or a 1 hand reverse grip - whichever you prefer.</li>\r\n\t<li>Keeping the lower back&nbsp;straight,&nbsp;start the lift by engaging your glutes, hamstrings and lower back (in that order). Keep your shins straight and vertical throughout the lift. Stand fully erect and that is the deadlift.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Tip: If you are having trouble getting the glutes to fire first then there are a couple of glute activation exercises you can do. The one easiest with no equipment is to lay on your back with the knees bent and thrusting the hips upward.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>2. POWER CLEAN TO OVERHEAD PRESS</h4>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Purpose:&nbsp;</strong>To improve total-body explosiveness and&nbsp;build upper-body and core strength.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Real-life application:&nbsp;</strong>Jumping and standing up fast. The ability to extend your hips, knees, and ankles powerfully is pivotal for applying force. Unlike the bench press, the overhead press has you on your feet,&nbsp;making you work on stabilising your body as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How to perform a Clean to overhead press:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Take hold of the bar with about a shoulder-width grip.</li>\r\n\t<li>Hinge your hips while keeping your knees bent. Extend your legs and thrust your hips forward.</li>\r\n\t<li>The bar should explode off from the ground. As it continues up, shrug your traps&nbsp;until it reaches about chest height.</li>\r\n\t<li>Flick your elbows forward and under the bar catching the bar across your collar bones. Settle the bar there (if necessary, widen the grip a little). With a slight dip of the knee, continue the momentum up and thrust the bar overhead.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Can&rsquo;t do the power clean and press? Replace it with this easier substitute: Dumbbell clean to press or kettlebell press.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>3. SQUAT</h4>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Purpose:&nbsp;</strong>To strengthen your lower body and enhance athletic posture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Real-life application:&nbsp;</strong>Jumping and pushing. Standing from a seated position</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How to perform a&nbsp; squat:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>For the general squat position, start with the bar in the rack, just below shoulder height. Grab the bar just wider than shoulder width (wider if this is not possible), flex the elbows backwards and you should feel a ridge forming where the traps tighten. This is the perfect position to rest the bar and will avoid you needing a barbell pad or a towel (both of which make for an unstable bar).</li>\r\n\t<li>Pick the bar off the rack and take a step backwards.</li>\r\n\t<li>Position your feet just wider than the deadlift position with the toes turned out a little further (this will allow for a better hip position).</li>\r\n\t<li>Keeping the bar pulled down into the traps, flex your lats and keep tight as you descend till your hips are positioned below the knees. You should go as low as your body will comfortably allow for a full range of motion but avoid going so low that you get what they call &ldquo;Butt Wink&rdquo;. At the bottom of the squat pause for a second then drive hard back to a standing position.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Can&rsquo;t do the squat? Replace it with this easier substitute: Step up or split squat (static lunge).<strong>&nbsp;</strong>These two strengthen your quads, glutes, and hamstrings thoroughly.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>4. CHIN UP</h4>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Purpose:</strong>&nbsp;To build upper body strength and relative strength.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Real-life application:</strong>&nbsp;Climbing, dragging, and wrestling - chin ups force you to master your own body weight while working the entire upper body.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How to perform a chin up:&nbsp;</strong>A&nbsp;chin up can be performed safely in many ways. There&rsquo;s wide grip, narrow grip, palms forward, palms backward, and palms neutral - all will work the back muscles.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Start by taking hold of the bar. You can use a palms towards you grip or a palms away from you grip. I prefer the palms facing me as I find I get a fuller range of motion through the lift.</li>\r\n\t<li>From your handing position, engage your shoulder muscles, and pull yourself up to the bar by&nbsp;concentrating on flexing your lats and pulling my elbows down and back behind you, as if you were elbowing someone behind&nbsp;you.&nbsp;</li>\r\n\t<li>Once you get your chin or chest to the bar, you can reverse the movement. Try to lower yourself slowly back to starting hanging position and keep the lats engaged.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>If you struggle with this move use a step to get into the top position and work on the decent. This is one of the best ways to get stronger at chin ups.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Can&rsquo;t do the chin up? Replace it with this easier substitute, a bent-over row or one-arm dumbbell row. Strong pulling movements helps improve posture and prevents shoulder pain.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>5. FARMERS WALK</h4>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Purpose:&nbsp;</strong>To build and strengthen the core whilst moving and improve posterior chain stability.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Real-life application:&nbsp;</strong>Walking, carrying, climbing stairs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How to perform a farmers walk:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>The farmers walk is relatively easy to perform. Pick up a weight in each hand and walk with it. If you want to perform this with much heavier weight some technique is necessary &ndash; The Worlds Strongest Man walks over 150kg per hand!</li>\r\n\t<li>Make sure to keep your chest up and your core tight.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Can&rsquo;t do the farmers walk? Start with a static lunge or a lighter weight farmers walk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Doing the above 5 moves regularly 2 to 3 times per week for 3 sets of 8 to 12 repetitions will help you through daily life long into old age. These are the movements we start to struggle with as we age such as getting up out of a chair, and walking with loads, so performing these exercises now will be beneficial in helping you stay healthy and strong.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here is an additional exercise if you can&rsquo;t perform the deadlift&nbsp;or clean:</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>HIP HINGE</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The hip hinge when performed correctly is very important in both the deadlift and the clean &ndash; here&rsquo;s how to perform it correctly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first thing to understand is the difference between a hinge and a squat:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Squat: Maximal knee bend and maximal hip bend</li>\r\n\t<li>Hinge: Minimal knee bend and maximal hip bend</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>When first learning the hip hinge, most people will want to bend at the knees when, in fact, they need to simply focus on pushing the butt back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How To Hip Hinge:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Start as close to the wall as needed (about 6-8 inches away fromt he wall). Begin by standing tall with feet about shoulder-width apart. Keep your chest up, shoulder blades retracted in toward the spine and head up and facing forward. I like to have people &ldquo;feel the hinge&rdquo; by placing their hands palms-up and gently pressing on the crease of the hip flexors just below the hip bone.</li>\r\n\t<li>Brace the abs and focus on moving the hips back until your butt touches the wall. You should feel the hips fold down on the hands as you hinge forward and remember, there should be very little bend in the knees!</li>\r\n\t<li>As you become more comfortable with your hinge you can slowly move further away from the wall.</li>\r\n</ol>", "thumbnail": "deadlift-feature.jpg", "publish_date": "2020-08-08T15:13:24.387Z", "last_updated": "2020-08-12T07:45:36.455Z", "author": 2, "slug": "5-functional-exercises-to-master", "featured": true}}, {"model": "blog.blog", "pk": 4, "fields": {"title": "UPPER BODY DUMBBELL WORKOUT", "category": "Strength Training", "content": "<p>Get an effective upper body workout with a friend using a pair of dumbbells. Watch the full workout featuring personal trainer</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Push ups are a great way to increase your upper body strength and working out with a partner is great way to boost motivation and overall performance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Start off by getting in to the full press up position. From here touch your shoulder with the opposite hand on both sides before performing the press up. Once back&nbsp;at the top of the movement, touch hands with your partner. Complete 10 reps, the main challenge is trying to keep in time with your partner.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>BICEP CURL INTO SHOULDER PRESS - 10 REPS</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>By combining these two popular upper body exercises you will be targeting more muscles groups at one time, so it&#39;s a ground all round upper body move to add to your upper body routine especially if you&#39;re short on time.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To perform the bicep curl into shoulder press move, grab a set of dumbbells. Stand upright with feet hip-width distance apart with your abs tight. Keeping your elbows tucked into your side, curl the dumbbell up towards your shoulders. From here rotate your arms as you push the dumbbells up and over your head. Slowly lower your dumbbells to the side of your ears, and return back to starting position. Avoid using momentum from your body. Complete a total of 10 reps before moving on to the next exercise.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>BENT OVER ROW - 10 REPS</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>A great exercise primarily targeting the middle back. The increased strength gained from performing this exercise can help to improve your posture and reduce the risk of lower back injuries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Grab one dumbbell and move to a bench or step. Start with placing the other hand on the bench or step, and the same side knee on the bench. Keeping your back straight, pull the dumbbell in towards your abs. Squeeze your back muscles at the top of the movement and slowly lower the weight back down. Complete 10 reps for each arm.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>OVERHEAD TRICEP EXTENSION - 10 REPS</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>This move is great for working the triceps whilst working your core. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Using both hands hold the dumbbell above your head. Lower the weight slowly keeping your elbows facing forward and squeeze through the triceps to return to the starting position. Aim for a total of 10 reps.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>LATERAL RAISE - 12 REPS</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>This exercise targets your shoulders, but will also work your core, upper back and arms.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Grab a dumbbell in each hand. Keeping your core tight and your chest up, slowly raise the dumbbells up to shoulder height keeping elbows bent. Slowly lower the dumbbells back to above</p>\r\n\r\n<p>your hips. Keep the movement controlled throughout. Perform 12 reps before heading into the final</p>\r\n\r\n<p>exercise.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>DUMBBELL SNATCH - 10 REPS</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>This dynamic, compound move is going to work the whole body and improve your power and coordination.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Position a dumbbell on the floor in between your legs. Take up a starting squat position with your feet slightly wider than shoulder width apart, toes slightly turned out. From this position, grab the dumbbell and drive upwards powerfully using your legs and thrust your hips forward. This should give you the momentum you need to lift the dumbbell above your head and hold it at the top. Make sure to keep the dumbbell close to your body throughout the whole movement. Return back to squat position as you lower the dumbbell back to the floor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alternate sides until 10 reps have been completed on each arm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That completes the workout. Give it a go with a friend next time you hit the gym!</p>", "thumbnail": "extra_images_0006_kaybeth.jpg", "publish_date": "2020-08-08T15:15:07.095Z", "last_updated": "2020-09-02T10:46:57.833Z", "author": 2, "slug": "upper-body-dumbbell-workout", "featured": false}}, {"model": "blog.blog", "pk": 5, "fields": {"title": "New to this", "category": "Members", "content": "<p>Hi everyone,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am very new to this blogging thing and to gym in general.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I have got my self some gear and I ready for the gym.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What would be the best way to start?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thanks all</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chat soon</p>", "thumbnail": "me.jpg", "publish_date": "2020-08-22T10:00:31.733Z", "last_updated": "2020-09-02T10:41:33.938Z", "author": 8, "slug": "new-to-this", "featured": false}}, {"model": "blog.blog", "pk": 6, "fields": {"title": "Going Plant-Based? Read This First", "category": "Dieting", "content": "<p>Plant-based eating is becoming increasingly popular, with more people ditching burgers and chicken for vegetarian alternatives every day. Cutting back on your meat consumption offers wide-ranging potential benefits, from losing weight to feeling more energetic, but a common concern is whether a&nbsp;plant-based diet&nbsp;can provide all the nutrients you need, especially if you lift weights or play sports.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The good news is, yes, it absolutely can, but you have to be strategic. Here are the FAQs on what you need to know to build a plant-based diet with enough power to fuel an active life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What do you eat on a plant-based diet?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Being on a &quot;plant-based diet&quot; means you&#39;re eating mostly plants, but you may sometimes eat animal products, too. It&#39;s different from a vegan diet, which means you eat only plants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Vegan diets may also be referred to as plant-based; however, individuals who sometimes eat meat can follow a plant-based eating pattern, too,&quot; explains Kelly Jones, MS, RD, CSSD, LDN. Plant-based eating also implies enjoying said plants as close to their original form as possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;A plant-based diet emphasizes whole plant foods such as legumes, whole grains, vegetables, fruits, nuts, and seeds as the stars of most meals and snacks,&quot; says Jones. &quot;It may include animal products, but the frequency and portion sizes of animal products are smaller than in most conventional American diets.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What are good plant sources of protein?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Soy, one of the most popular plant proteins worldwide, is a great option. Soy products such as tempeh, tofu, and edamame are easy staple foods, with a high protein count per serving.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Says Jones, &quot;Soy is well known as the most high-quality plant protein when it comes to essential amino acid content and bioavailability.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Tofu\" src=\"https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2020/august/a-guide-to-going-plant-based-1-700xh.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite the popular myth that soy will mess up your hormones, research suggests that to the contrary, isoflavones in soy may provide a variety of health benefits.[1] So, grill up some soy burgers or make a stir-fry with veggies and cubed tofu for an easy weeknight meal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other legumes such as beans, lentils, and split peas are also high in protein, as are grains such as faro, quinoa (technically a seed but acts like a grain), and bulgur.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nuts provide protein, too. Eat lots of high-protein nuts like pistachios and peanuts (technically a legume but acts like a nut). Other nuts such as macadamias and pecans are lower in protein but high in other important nutrients, so don&#39;t count them out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Can you get enough protein from plants?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>You may wonder how you&#39;re going to live without steak and chicken for muscle repair and recovery, but you can actually thrive on plant-based proteins, with a little meat if you want. The key is to eat a wide variety of plant proteins every day. While animal proteins provide all the essential amino acids your body needs for muscle repair and growth, most plant proteins contain some, but not all EAAs. (Quinoa, soy, and pistachios are the exception, as they each provide the full lineup of EAAs.) By including a mix of whole grains, nuts, seeds, and legumes in your diet, you can rack up all the EAAs you would get from animal sources.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Quinoa\" src=\"https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2020/august/a-guide-to-going-plant-based-2-700xh.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To maximize your EAA intake, Jones suggests prioritizing the grains, legumes, and nuts that are highest in protein. For example, rather than pairing lentils with rice, which is low in protein, consider swapping the rice for faro or quinoa which are both higher in protein. And spread your high-protein whole-grain bread with peanut or pistachio butter, rather than cashew butter, which is lower in protein than the others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As you begin to replace animal products in your diet with plant-based alternatives, keep in mind that these foods are sometimes lower in protein than their animal counterparts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Foods such as jackfruit, almond milk, coconut yogurt, and many veggie burgers do not contain significant amounts of protein,&quot; Jones says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Be creative with your meal planning. Add hemp and chia seeds to that coconut yogurt to up the protein. Pour almond milk over granola with nuts. And remember, it&#39;s still OK to eat meat in moderation, so when it&#39;s time to fire up the grill, an occasional turkey or chicken burger can be a good choice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Why is leucine important?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>All the essential amino acids are important for health, but the one that&#39;s most important for muscle and strength is the branched-chain amino acid leucine. If you eat a variety of plant foods but still feel you aren&#39;t maximizing your fitness gains on a plant-based diet, you may need more leucine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Leucine is the BCAA found to act as an important trigger to muscle protein synthesis post-workout, and it&#39;s found in greater amounts in tofu, soy milk, adzuki beans, lentils, buckwheat, and pumpkin seeds, for example,&quot; Jones says.[2]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can also up your leucine with a BCAA supplement. Look for&nbsp;plant-based BCAA&nbsp;products&mdash;if it isn&#39;t labeled as vegan or fermented, it&#39;s probably made from animal sources.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Should you use plant-based protein powder?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Protein powder\" src=\"https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2020/august/a-guide-to-going-plant-based-3-700xh.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>While it&#39;s possible to get all the protein you need from whole plant foods, a&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://focus-fitness.herokuapp.com/products/4/\">protein powder</a>&nbsp;offers a little extra insurance, especially if you do strength sports or bodybuilding and have great protein needs. Using protein powder from rice, peas, hemp, or soy in a shake, as well as putting it in&nbsp;recipes, can aid muscle growth and strength, in addition to keeping you full and reducing cravings. Blend in greens, nuts, seeds, and fresh fruit for a healthy, nutrient-packed smoothie to speed muscle recovery after workouts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Do plant foods provide enough calories and carbs?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Plant-based diets can help promote a healthy weight since they naturally help curb your appetite, but sometimes they work too well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;When transitioning to plant-based eating, you are naturally going to include more fiber in your diet, which promotes feelings of fullness,&quot; says Jones. &quot;While this is a good thing for most people, and fiber offers many other health benefits, it may lead to premature fullness as your body adjusts to its new eating pattern.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Plus, fruits and veggies tend to be lower in calories, so your total calorie intake could go too low without you noticing. You want to make sure you&#39;re still eating enough calories to fuel yourself and repair your muscles, especially if you&#39;re active. The same goes for carbs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Be sure to include carbohydrate sources lower in fiber before and during exercise, and don&#39;t fear a little extra fruit or even 100 percent juice to ensure adequate calorie intake,&quot; Jones says. Bananas, potatoes, cereal, bread, and rice cakes are all good low-fiber options.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Potatoes\" src=\"https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2020/august/a-guide-to-going-plant-based-4-700xh.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Since carbohydrates are the most efficient source of energy for high-intensity exercise and the central nervous system, and they have a protein-sparing effect, limiting calories and carbohydrates can contribute to muscle loss or at least impair the ability to optimally repair and grow muscle,&quot; Jones cautions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, don&#39;t just eat veggies all day&mdash;add those great grains, beans, legumes, and fruits rich in complex carbs and fiber, as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What supplements should you take while on a plant-based diet?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite the wealth of vitamins and minerals plant foods offer, some nutrients are difficult to get enough of from plants. If you&#39;re cutting out animal products entirely, Jones advises taking a vegan vitamin B12 supplement, as animal products are the main dietary sources of this essential vitamin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s also a good idea to supplement with a vegan vitamin D3, since it&#39;s hard to produce the active form of vitamin D in the body, beyond sun exposure. Vitamin D is important not only for bone health and antioxidant power, but also the role it plays in fast-twitch muscle fiber reactions, which are extremely important for strength training and athletics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For females, iron supplements may be helpful when transitioning to a plant-based diet, but it is possible to get the iron you need from plant foods such as green vegetables, especially when combined with other foods.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Vitamin C enhances plant-iron absorption, so try to include a source of vitamin C at most meals and snacks,&quot; Jones says. &quot;Think citrus, kiwi, peppers, potatoes, spinach, and broccoli.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But if you&#39;re having symptoms of iron-deficiency anemia despite eating plenty of foods containing iron and vitamin C, consider consulting a nutritionist.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Omega-3 fatty acids are also difficult to get from plants. If you do include occasional animal foods in your plant-based diet, taking fish oil or eating fish can provide the omega-3 fats you need. Otherwise, consider an&nbsp;omega-3 supplement made from algae.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>References</h5>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Rizzo, G., &amp; Baroni, L.

Here are the lessons of lockdown fitness life so far, and for whatever comes next. Learn them or wish you had!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fitness, as everywhere else, the coronavirus has pulled no punches across the globe. Whether you&#39;re on full quarantine, kinda-lockdown, or you&#39;re free to train in a mostly empty gym, we&#39;ve all been asked to make some form of compromise to our typical routine. It&#39;s forced many people to get innovative, and also take stock of what was really important and unimportant in their training.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One thing that is definitely showing itself to be important? Flexibility. And I&#39;m not talking about your tight hamstrings. I&#39;m talking about being able to make the most of any situation, in any setting, with any (or no) equipment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the world is still struggling to figure out what to do next, the fitness lessons of this stage of the COVID-19 crisis are looking pretty clear. Here&#39;s what I&#39;ve seen people learning, and what I try to pass along to them as a coach and trainer</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Lesson 1: Have Realistic Expectations</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I&#39;ve seen an alarming number of articles circulating the internet that seem to be claiming you can &quot;make new gains&quot; using a simple bodyweight training program alone in your living room&mdash;even if you&#39;re coming off of a long history of moving heavy weights and doing specific patterns with machines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&#39;s get real.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This isn&#39;t to come across like a downer, but if your goals involve insane strength or packing on tons of muscle, you&#39;re not about to set new records by performing bodyweight-only work, or working out with a pair of 5-pound dumbbells. The best you&#39;ll be able to do is maintain your current levels of muscle and strength until you can return to the training that promotes your specific goals&mdash;and even that is going to require work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But this isn&#39;t a bad thing&mdash;it&#39;s just a push for you to set new goals in the interim. And it&#39;s up to you to either let that push guide you somewhere positive, or hold your ground and feel frustrated. A poorly equipped gym and some floor space makes for a great gateway to things like calisthenic training and conditioning workouts&mdash;the kind of things that help you shed some fat, get a pump, and give your joints a break.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&#39;s nothing wrong with the sort of fitness that isn&#39;t based in top-level strength, epic performance, or anything remotely elite. When it&#39;s all you&#39;ve got, there&#39;s a case for focusing on feeling pretty good and staying lean-ish. So if you&#39;ve been struggling to see that, well, see it.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Lesson 2: Be At Least A Little Equipped</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I can make an endless list on useful home gym equipment to buy, but the article would end up being 8,000 words and be no different than any other list. I know you&#39;re probably not about to stock your home gym with everything that a big box gym has. Serious equipment is more expensive than ever, and just as inconvenient as ever. It&#39;s for a certain type of person, but not most of us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So no, I&#39;m not recommending squat stands, barbells, and hundreds of pounds of plates. I&#39;m recommending cheap, bare essentials that can go a long way, and that take up little to no space in your closet or a corner of your bedroom or living room. Things like:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>2 Pairs of Dumbbells:</strong>&nbsp;You read it right: two pairs. One light pair&mdash;say, under 20 pounds&mdash;and one heavier pair, preferably over 40 pounds. This gives you the freedom of making some good combinations and having an array of exercises to choose from that can challenge most muscle groups in a pinch.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>1 Kettlebell, Medium Weight:</strong>&nbsp;Not a pair, just a single. Why? The amount of unilateral or bilateral conditioning you can do with a single kettlebell is unreal. How heavy do you go? I&#39;d suggest choosing a weight you can still comfortably strict press over your head six times with one arm. For many people who train, that&#39;s probably going to be 16-20 kg, or 35-45 pounds. If that sounds heavy, go with 8-12 kg, or 19-26 pounds.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Exercise Mat and Adjustable Bench:</strong>&nbsp;Just like you&#39;d find at the gym. A basic mat and typical bench that adjusts from flat to incline to upright are going to be immensely helpful. Yes, you can try to make a bench out of a yoga ball or some other thing in the house. Me, I like having an actual bench. There are solid, inexpensive ones out there that can work equally well for step-ups, supported rows, and all types of presses. It&#39;s worth it.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Loop Bands:</strong>&nbsp;Get a variety. One skinny, one medium width, and one heavier. It&#39;s nice, but not essential, to have a small loop for wrist and hip work, also.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Working out with a kettlebell on a mat.\" src=\"https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2020/august/real-fitness-lessons-of-lockdown-inset2-700xh.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>And that&#39;s it. Like I said, a couple hundred bucks is more than enough to spend on this, and it&#39;s a worthwhile investment without getting deep into four-digit territory with heavy-duty space occupying weight equipment.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Lesson 3: Embrace Higher-Rep Training</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Sure, you can try to get crazy strong at home, knocking out single-arm push-ups and other solid feats. But again, that&#39;s not for most people. I say that when you&#39;re strapped for equipment and gym access, if it ain&#39;t double digits, it ain&#39;t worth your time. Nuff said.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Lesson 4: Program In Patterns</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>You can try to recreate your bro-split with the equipment above, and you might be able to do it for a while, but I recommend thinking a bit differently about your split. One of my favorites for home training is:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>Day 1:</strong>&nbsp;Vertical lifts</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Day 2:</strong>&nbsp;Horizontal lifts</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Day 3:</strong>&nbsp;Core/miscellaneous</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>That approach allows you to focus on certain muscle groups more than others on certain days, while still giving the benefits of full-body training, like fat loss and time efficiency. Here&#39;s how it can look in a<a href=\"https://focus-fitness.herokuapp.com/programs/\"> program</a>.</p>", "thumbnail": "real-fitness-lessons-of-lockdown-header-830x467.jpg", "publish_date": "2020-09-05T10:08:40.494Z", "last_updated": "2020-09-05T10:08:40.494Z", "author": 10, "slug": "the-real-fitness-lessons-of-lockdown", "featured": false}}, {"model": "blog.blog", "pk": 8, "fields": {"title": "4 Reasons You're Not Adding Muscle", "category": "Strength Training", "content": "<p>Slow-to-no gains got you down? Here are four tips to reverse that trend and kick-start the muscle-building process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When it comes to gaining muscle, there are many contributing factors. Let&#39;s look at what you&#39;re doing that could potentially be holding you back in the gym.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>1. You&#39;re Not Overtraining, You&#39;re Under-Recovering</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Consider what weight training does to your body. By lifting weights, you are tearing down your muscles, so you don&#39;t gain muscle simply by lifting weights. You see gains only when you help your muscles recover from the work you do in the gym.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Recovery can come in many forms. In my opinion, there are three main areas of recovery that everyone should be aiding&mdash;not only to gain muscle, but also if you want to improve your general health.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Nutrition</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>What you fuel your body with before and after your workouts will dictate how well you perform in the gym and whether or not you&nbsp;gain weight.&nbsp;If you eat like crap, you&#39;ll feel like crap. If you eat foods that provide your body with adequate amounts of nutrients, your muscles will recover from the weights and grow back fuller and stronger.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Mobility</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Mobility&nbsp;isn&#39;t just for people who do yoga. Everyone can benefit from having better mobility. If you lift weights and don&#39;t pay any attention to improving and maintaining your joint range of motion, you&#39;re setting yourself up for injury. Adding mobility work to your routine consistently will help your body recover from training and lead to improvements in overall strength, health, and muscle gain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"4 Reasons Youre Not Adding Muscle\" src=\"https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2019/june/4-reasons-youre-not-adding-muscle-1-700xh.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Sleep</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>You cannot cheat your&nbsp;<a href=\"https://focus-fitness.herokuapp.com/blog/4-reasons-youre-not-adding-muscle/update/\">sleep</a>. Period. Everyone has different schedules, but you should try to get at least seven hours of quality sleep every night. If you go to the gym feeling tired and sleep deprived, you won&#39;t perform as well as you would if you&#39;d had a full night&#39;s sleep. Occasionally, you can get away with eating unhealthfully and still have a decent workout, but when you train on a bad night&#39;s sleep, there&#39;s no amount of caffeine that will help you. Lack of sleep will increase cortisol levels, which leads to more body fat and fewer muscle gains. So, get to bed!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>2. You&#39;re Focused On Testing Rather Than Building</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Leave your ego at the gym door because it is holding you back from packing on muscle. A lot of people feel that they have to lift as much weight as they can. They want to test how strong they are today, rather than working on building their strength. They put more weight on the bar than they can handle and end up missing a lot of reps and failing their set. If you treat every workout like a competition, you are headed down a dead-end street. If you treat your workouts like building blocks that work together to achieve a greater goal, you will add muscle and get stronger.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To do that, you need to consider volume in your training plan. Volume is the total amount of weight you lift over the course of a workout. It&#39;s a key factor in your progress and an excellent illustration of why pushing max weights doesn&#39;t always bring max gains.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&#39;s say you get to the gym and it&#39;s bench day. You put 135 pounds on the bar and start your workout. On the first set, you complete 10 reps. On the second set, you get 7, and on the third set, you manage 4 reps until someone has to pry the bar off your chest. You have successfully completed 21 reps, which is a total volume of 2,835 pounds (135 x 21 = 2,835).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To begin with, you didn&#39;t warm up before getting to your working weight, and as a result, you weren&#39;t prepared to do 3 sets of 10 with 135 pounds. Beyond that, however, you&#39;d have been better off with less weight on the bar. Let&#39;s say you do at least a few warm-up sets and drop the working weight down to 125 pounds. You perform the first set and get 10 reps. You get 10 reps again on your second and third sets, successfully completing 30 reps with 125 pounds, a total volume of 3,750 pounds, not including the warm-up sets. So, by putting less on the bar, you lifted 915 pounds more weight (3,750 &ndash; 2,935 = 915), a huge difference in volume.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"4 Reasons Youre Not Adding Muscle\" src=\"https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2019/june/4-reasons-youre-not-adding-muscle-2-700xh.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>3. You&#39;re Emphasizing Isolation And Machine Exercises Over Compound Lifts</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>There is definitely a time and place for isolation exercises. Everyone loves doing push-downs, bar curls, and lat pull-downs, and I&#39;m no different. It&#39;s also true that a large portion of the gym population focuses heavily on isolation movements while neglecting the compound lifts. If your goal is to add muscle, think of your workout as a three-course meal. Your appetizer is the warm-up, your main course is the compound lifts, and dessert is the isolation exercises.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Compound lifts are multijoint exercises that incorporate more than one muscle group at a time. They include squats, presses, deadlifts, and pull-ups, just to name a few. Compound exercises not only add muscle but will make you stronger, and the stronger you are, the more muscle fibers you can engage. The more muscles you engage in a movement&mdash;whether it&#39;s a compound lift or an isolation move&mdash;the more weight you can handle, and the more weight you can handle, the more your muscles are going to grow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can&#39;t add muscle without a basic foundation of strength, and you don&#39;t get stronger by doing curls. You get stronger by putting your body in a position where it has to engage a maximal amount of muscle fibers in order to produce force to move an external load. If you focus purely on&nbsp;isolation movements, you are simply pumping blood. If you focus on lifting with big, compound movements, you engage more motor units, which leads to more strength, more muscle, and more gains.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>4. You Don&#39;t Have Enough Variety In Your Routine</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Exercise variety is a key factor in building muscle. Remember when you first started working out and felt really sore the next day? Your muscles weren&#39;t used to performing the new exercises and were adapting to them. Whether you are an experienced trainer or a beginner, your muscles respond to new movements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you put the best men&#39;s bodybuilder in the world in a ballet class, I guarantee you he&#39;ll be feeling muscles he&#39;s never felt before for at least the next few days. That&#39;s because his muscles have become used to performing a certain way and when taken out of their comfort zone, they are challenged to work differently.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even so, the muscles get bored fast, so if you have been following the same routine with the same exercises, lifting the same weight, at the same intensity and can&#39;t remember the last time you&#39;ve seen results, try adding some new exercises. That doesn&#39;t mean doing something completely random every other day, it means sprinkling new exercises throughout your program to challenge your muscles so they don&#39;t get bored.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"4 Reasons Youre Not Adding Muscle\" src=\"https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2019/june/4-reasons-youre-not-adding-muscle-3-700xh.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another way to add variety to your workout is to use the same exercises but change the order in which you perform them in your workout. If you always start leg day with squats, try doing hip thrusts or lunges first. If you always start chest day with bench presses, try doing an incline press first to create a new stimulus in the muscles.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Key Points For Adding Muscle</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are your takeaways for how to shake up your workouts and stimulate gains:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Allow your body to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/8-ways-to-maximize-your-post-workout-recovery.html\">recover</a>&nbsp;from the gym by getting sufficient nutrition, doing mobility work, and getting quality sleep.</li>\r\n\t<li>Treat your workouts like building blocks to a greater goal and work with weights that you can lift for the full sets and reps.</li>\r\n\t<li>Focus on performing compound lifts and use isolation exercises to help improve the main lifts.</li>\r\n\t<li>Make your muscles work in new ways and add variety to your exercises.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Focus-fitness.com <a href=\"https://focus-fitness.herokuapp.com/programs/\">Programs</a>&nbsp;contains&nbsp;workout plans that incorporate these sorts of training strategies and more! <a href=\"https://focus-fitness.herokuapp.com/memberships/\">Join today</a> and begin the plan that&#39;s right for you!</em></p>", "thumbnail": "4-reasons-youre-not-adding-muscle-header-830x467.jpg", "publish_date": "2020-09-05T10:17:38.302Z", "last_updated": "2020-09-05T10:22:31.226Z", "author": 10, "slug": "4-reasons-youre-not-adding-muscle", "featured": false}}, {"model": "blog.blog", "pk": 9, "fields": {"title": "The Importance Of Sleep", "category": "Recover", "content": "<p>Throughout this article I will explain the various stages of sleep and their implications for bodybuilders. Outlined also will be the benefits sleep has in terms of muscle recovery and growth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As bodybuilders we are constantly on the lookout for new and effective ways to gain muscle. The latest supplement, a sophisticated training routine, a new diet. Granted, all of these things are crucially important but what is possibly most important of all is sleep.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The best training routine, diet and supplement program will not compensate for insufficient rest, and sleep is the best, and only (in some instances), way of getting this rest. Professor Michael Colgan went as far as to say: even if your training and nutrition program can straight for the mouth of God almighty, without adequate rest your body will fail to adapt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During sleep, growth hormone is produced and protein synthesis (provided protein is consumed prior to sleep) occurs. These are only two beneficial aspects of sleep. Energy consumption reduction and brain cell restoration are two other aspects equally important for bodybuilders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Throughout this article I will explain the various stages of sleep and their implications for bodybuilders. Outlined also will be the benefits sleep has in terms of muscle recovery and growth.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Why Do We Sleep?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Sleep serves many vital functions. For bodybuilders the main functions are growth and mental alertness. Sleep provides these effects directly. Without adequate sleep, time in the gym could be, to a large degree, wasted. The following are important functions of sleep.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Repairing Of Muscle And Other Tissues, And Replacement Of Aging Or Dead Cells</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Sleeping for 8-10 hours per night is similar to fasting and this is catabolic to muscle growth. However, eating just prior to sleeping, can help to reverse this process and increase protein synthesis. Protein synthesis does occur under conditions of sleep but it occurs in the gastrointestinal tract, not the muscles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Muscle is actually broken down under these conditions to provide our stomach with amino acids during this time of starvation. Eating before bed is crucial in offsetting this. Some reports suggest waking up in the middle of the night to eat (nocturnal eating).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"The Importance Of Sleep!\" src=\"https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2015/december/the-importance-of-sleep_01-700xh.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Human growth hormone is also released under conditions of sleep. In men, 60% to 70% of daily human growth hormone secretion occurs during early sleep which is typically when the deepest sleep cycles occur. Poor quality sleep can negatively impact human growth hormone levels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Research suggests that it&#39;s during REM (Rapid Eye Movement: explained later) sleep that the body is able to: restore organs, bones, and tissue; replenish immune cells; and circulate human growth hormone. Sleep has a profound effect on muscle growth and physical well being.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>During Sleep Energy Consumption Is Lowered</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Lowered energy consumption is a biological mechanism for resource conservation. We would need many meals per day (rather than the normal 4-6 for bodybuilders) if we did not get enough sleep.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With bodybuilders, the name of the game is increased size, so energy conservation out of the gym is paramount. Several meals throughout the day also assists growth, and sleep helps to ensure that food is used to replace energy and rebuild muscle (pre-sleep meals and nocturnal eating help to intensify this effect).</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Sleep To Recharge The Brain</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Adenosine (a neurotransmitter that produces ATP, the energy-storage molecule that powers most of the biochemical reactions inside cells) is used as a signal to tell the brain that it needs to rest. Rising and declining concentrations of adenosine suggest that the brain is actually resting during sleep given that adenosine secretion reflects brain activity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During sleep, levels of adenosine decline. Blocking adenosine in the brain has been shown to increase alertness, so this suggests that during sleep the brain is recharging. During the day heightened levels of adenosine, particularly toward the end of the day, suggest that the brain is getting tired.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Resting the brain has obvious implications for bodybuilders given that mental alertness is desired during the day, especially during training. Motivation levels are highest when mental alertness is highest. Studies suggest that it is during REM sleep that proper functioning of the brain and alertness is assisted.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Stages Of Sleep And The Sleep/Wake Cycle</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The brain follows cycles during sleep, which last between 90 and 100 minutes each. The two different types of sleep are REM and non-REM sleep. A sleep cycle begins with 4 stages of non-REM sleep before they reverse and REM sleep commences. Most people experience around 5 of these cycles per night.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Knowing about sleeps stages are important for bodybuilders as the stages typically follow a set pattern and to adequately recover (get a good night of sleep, and grow) ones brain must experience all of these stages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A lack of REM and stage three and four sleep is particularly problematic because it is during these periods that the body and brain are complete rest (stages three and four) and memory consolidation occurs (REM). During stages three and four the body and brain are completely at rest due to the slowing of brain activity that occurs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"The Importance Of Sleep!\" src=\"https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2015/december/the-stages-of-sleep-infographic-v2-700xh.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Due to the neurotransmitter acetylcholine&#39;s activation in the pons, which in turn activates the medulla, during REM sleep, the body becomes paralysed. This is because the medulla inhibits motor neurons and gives rise to atonia (complete immobility). Newborn babies undergo about 50% of REM sleep per night.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This level decreases as one ages, until, by adulthood, REM will account for 20-25% of sleep per night. The phenomenal growth that occurs as the baby makes the transition to childhood, then to adulthood, suggests that REM is beneficial for growth. Sleep research is not conclusive on this point but many bodybuilders will attest to the benefits of a complete night of uninterrupted sleep (8-10 hours).</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>The Stages</h5>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>Stage One:</strong>&nbsp;Considered the transition stage between sleepfulness and wakefulness, stage one non-REM sleep is the shortest period (2-5%) of sleep in the sleep/wake cycle.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Stage Two:</strong>&nbsp;Considered the baseline of sleep, non-REM sleep stage two accounts for 45-60% of sleep.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Stages Three &amp; Four:</strong>&nbsp;Termed delta sleep, non-REM sleep stages three and four account for up to 40% of sleep time. These are the deepest stages of sleep and the most restorative for the brain.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>REM Sleep:</strong>&nbsp;The most active stage of sleep REM accounts for 20-25% of a normal nights sleep. Breathing, heart rate and brain activity quicken during this stage.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>Getting Adequate Sleep</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Often it is hard to get a good night of sleep. Even when we do fall asleep the quality of the sleep may not be sufficient. The following ways can assist in getting that good night sleep and subsequently the benefits thereof.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li><strong>Never Oversleep:</strong>&nbsp;Oversleeping may set the bodies clock to a different cycle. This will make trying to fall asleep much harder.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Take A Warm Bath:</strong>&nbsp;A warm bath will sooth and relax. However, a shower will have the opposite effect so these should be avoided.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Exercise:</strong>&nbsp;Exercising, particularly aerobic, during the day will sufficiently tire one out and sleep will come faster at night. Intense training sessions during the late evening will have the opposite effect.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Avoid Alcohol, Caffeine &amp; Tyrosine-Rich Foods At Night:</strong>&nbsp;Caffeine&nbsp;causes hyperactivity and wakefulness.&nbsp;Tyrosine- rich foods are brain stimulating and may keep one awake. Alcohol significantly disrupts sleep by interfering with the stages of sleep.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Avoid Sleeping Pills:</strong>&nbsp;These may work temporarily but in the long term will cause disturbed sleep patterns.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Correct Sleeping Environment:</strong>&nbsp;Keep your room reasonably cool (about 60 degrees). Humidity may cause disrupted sleep. A fan running or soft background music may help to relax and encourage sleep.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Make evenings relaxed</strong>, not stressful affairs.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Do not watch television in bed.</strong>&nbsp;This may also increase alertness. The brain may also decide that bedtime is for television watching and refuse to sleep.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>As research has shown, sleep is important for any reasons. For bodybuilders, sleep is particularly important as it restores brain function and alertness in preparation for intense training sessions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sleep also enhances muscular recovery through protein synthesis and human growth hormone release. Getting eight to ten hours of quality sleep every night will promote these factors as well as general well being.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Recovery will take a backward step if one does not prioritize sleep, so get to sleep if you want to grow.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>References</h5>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Colgan, M.(1993).

Here&#39;s what you need to know.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The workout is over and you&#39;re covered in sweat, visual proof of a hard effort. You pushed yourself to the max, lit your glutes on fire, and now you&#39;re feeling great about a job well done.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But this is when the real work starts. What many women fail to realize is the real magic doesn&#39;t happen when you&#39;re in the gym, it happens when you&#39;re out of it. Training tears your body apart. It&#39;s when you rest and recover that your body repairs all those damaged muscle tissues and ensures you come back stronger than ever before.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Adopt some of these eight habits to benefit more from the workouts you already do and kick your fitness up a notch.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>1. Grab The Foam Roller</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Chances are you&#39;re already doing a few stretches to finish up your workout. While you&#39;re on the mat, add foam rolling into your routine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Foam rolling is an excellent technique to break up scar tissue from exercise, stimulate blood flow, and loosen the muscle tissues to lessen post-workout pain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What&#39;s more, if you do it routinely, foam rolling can keep you supple and help you side-step injury in the long run.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>2. Take A Probiotic</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Probiotics improve recovery? Weird, but true. The healthy bacteria in your gut play a key role in keeping not only your digestive system but your immune system healthy as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Grab a priobotic\" src=\"https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2019/september/revel-8-ways-to-maximize-your-post-workout-recovery-1-700xh.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A healthy immune system doesn&#39;t just guard against illness, it enables your body to tolerate the stressors of day-to-day life&mdash;exercise included. Hard workouts take more of a toll and are harder to recover from when your immune system isn&#39;t up to snuff.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And since up to 80 percent of your immune system resides in your gut, this all begins with proper probiotic levels.[1]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not into eating yogurt or kimchi every day? Pick up a quality probiotic supplement &nbsp;and you&#39;ll be all set.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>3. Consume Enough Protein</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Think protein shakes are just for people trying to get big? Think again. A post-workout protein shake gives your muscles a quick shot of amino acids to jump-start recovery, while also helping you meet your total protein requirements. Not sure how much protein you need in a day? Use this&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/calpro.htm\">protein calculator</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://focus-fitness.herokuapp.com/products/4/\">Protein</a>&nbsp;is a great choice. It has added digestive enzymes for optimal digestion and absorption, as well as fiber to keep you full.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GO NOW</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>4. Eat Real Food</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>While the post-workout shake tells your muscles it&#39;s time to rebuild and repair, it&#39;s not enough to fuel recovery by itself. About an hour after your workout, eat a balanced post-workout meal of fresh foods.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For this meal, you want a solid source of protein along with some complex carbohydrates.[2] Now is not the time to skimp on those carbs! Your body will use them to replenish muscle glycogen levels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even if you follow a low-carb diet, consume most of the carbs you do allow shortly after your workout. This is when your body can optimize its use of them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also be sure to include fresh veggies or fruits, which provide antioxidants and other important micronutrients that help your body recover. Plus, they taste good!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>5. Rehydrate</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>When you sweat during exercise, you lose a lot of water, affecting your muscles&#39; (and other systems&#39;) ability to function. A post-workout hydration drink can help replace it to promote optimal recovery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You could grab a sugary sports drink, but&nbsp;Revel Recovery&nbsp;provides greater benefits without the empty calories. It&#39;s made with coconut water, one of the best natural ways to rehydrate and promote faster recovery from exercise.[3] Coconut water&#39;s natural potassium content helps you absorb the liquid you ingest, making it better than water alone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Recovery is important\" src=\"https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2019/september/revel-8-ways-to-maximize-your-post-workout-recovery-2-700xh.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This multifunction fitness supplement also contains vegan branched-chain amino acids, which will help take your recovery one step further. And it tastes so good you&#39;ll want to sip it all day long. Dehydration? Never heard of it.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>6. Consider Collagen</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>One more bonus ingredient in Revel Recovery is collagen. Collagen is a protein peptide that makes up tendons, ligaments, and other connective tissue. Healthy connective tissue is crucial for avoiding training injuries, such as tendonitis or torn ligaments, that can derail your hard-earned progress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Collagen supplements help support joint health so you can stay in the game. You can also get collagen from bone broth, meat, and fish&mdash;especially if you eat the skin.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>7. Periodize Your Program</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The kind of exercise routine you perform in the first place is a huge part of the recovery process. Even if you don&#39;t consider yourself a hardcore athlete, it&#39;s super important to periodize your training.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Periodization means there are times you push hard and times you back off and focus on lighter workouts, rest, and recovery. This approach is typical among athletes, as it ensures you push hard and improve physical fitness, while still allowing adequate rest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Every week, build in easy exercise and recovery days around your tougher workouts. Every month or so, trade your challenging program for a whole week of less-intense workouts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>8. Take 10</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>After you shower and head out of the locker room, don&#39;t just rush to carry on with the rest of your day. Instead, take 10 minutes for yourself. Take a scenic route home, sit with your thoughts, savor that delicious post-workout meal, or find something small you enjoy to cleanse the stress from your life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of us are in go, go, go mode and rarely let up. This contributes to feeling overwhelmed, stressed out, and unable to cope.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Any form of stress, be it life stress or training stress, takes a toll on our ability to recover from physical exercise.[4] The body can only handle so much, so it&#39;s vital to give yourself a breather every now and then to regain your sense of calm and control. Remember, life is about more than work, fitness, and nutrition!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Recovery isn&#39;t a one-step process. It&#39;s basically everything you do when you&#39;re not working out. Do it right, and your time in the gym becomes worth so much more.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>References</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Zoumpopoulou, G., Pot, B., Tsakalidou, E., &amp; Papadimitriou, K.

It&#39;s also frequently experienced by athletes of both sexes who compete in fitness or bodybuilding. Frequently overhead from competitors are comments such as:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Now that the show is finished, I don&#39;t have to be so strict with my diet, but I just can&#39;t stop eating.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I&#39;ve put on so much weight after my first bikini competition.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I find it harder to lose weight the second time around, and I just don&#39;t understand why, because I&#39;m following the same program and the same diet as last time.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I lack motivation getting back into things after competing.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To understand how rebound weight gain happens, let&#39;s start by looking at the typical fitness diet, if there is such a thing. These are some of the basic factors:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Up to six regular meals per day</li>\r\n\t<li>Protein (shakes or dietary protein) with every meal</li>\r\n\t<li>A typical meal includes animal protein, vegetables, maybe a starch (sweet potato, potato, rice)</li>\r\n\t<li>Fats kept to a minimum</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Usually, starches and fats are stripped down close to a competition to reduce muscle glycogen as much as possible while maintaining muscle mass. Both are essential to looking &quot;shredded&quot; onstage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even a weight-loss-promoting diet like this has some potential pitfalls:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Excess protein can be converted into glucose, which can then be converted into fat.</li>\r\n\t<li>A low fat intake may result in fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies, dry skin, and dry hair.</li>\r\n\t<li>Severe carbohydrate restriction causes changes in the microbiome due to low dietary polyphenol and fiber intake.</li>\r\n\t<li>Severe carbohydrate restriction can also result in mood changes, depression, and sleep disruption due to lower tryptophan absorption. Sleep disturbances may disrupt circadian rhythms of many hormonal peptides such as insulin and growth hormone, which may influence muscle and fat mass.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Most athletes are careful not to make these common mistakes, but even the most calculated diets can result in post-competition weight gain and an inability to lose weight even years later.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The reasons are simple: It is not sustainable and it changes the gut microbiome.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To understand post-competition rebound weight gain, as well as why over time it may become harder to lose fat, we need to look at the gut microbiome, its influence on metabolic functions, and how diet affects this in the long term.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>The Role Of The Gut Microbiome In Weight Loss</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Gut bacteria have the job of breaking down dietary fiber and turning it into short-chain fatty acids such as butyrate, which helps to feed the cells lining the colon, regulate immune function, decrease appetite, and improve insulin signaling in fat cells.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The microbiome also affects fat metabolism through the suppression of lipoprotein lipase activity in the fat cells. Lipoprotein lipase is an enzyme that breaks down fats in fat cells to be used for energy, and its activity is high during weight loss. Hormonal peptides such as insulin suppress lipoprotein lipase function&mdash;which explains why insulin isn&#39;t just an anabolic hormone that helps build muscle. When insulin is present in higher-than-normal amounts, it also can encourage fat storage rather than breakdown. This is commonly seen in people with insulin resistance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Maintaining a balance between various microorganisms in the gut is important when it comes to preventing metabolic disorders and supporting weight loss. It is estimated that human gut bacteria provide 2-3 million bacterial genes in the gut alone to regulate digestion, fat absorption, carbohydrate absorption, insulin, hormones, and neurotransmitters. Human gut bacteria provide up to 100 times more unique genes than our own genome does![1] So the human gut microbiome is both rich and diverse.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>A Tale Of Two Categories: High Gene Count And Low Gene Count</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Regarding weight gain and loss, gut bacteria can be divided into two categories: high gene count (HGC) and low gene count (LGC). The HGC microbiome includes species such as these:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Anaerotruncus colihominis</li>\r\n\t<li>Butyrivibrio crossotus</li>\r\n\t<li>Akkermansia sp.</li>\r\n\t<li>Faecalibacterium sp.</li>\r\n\t<li>Bifidobacterium spp.</li>\r\n\t<li>A high Akkermansia (Verrucomicrobia)-to-Ruminococcus torque/gnavus ratio.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The HGC-dominant microbiome tends to favor the production of the short-chain fatty acid butyrate and hydrogen. Both are needed to regulate immune function in the gut by feeding good bacteria and killing bad bacteria.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When robust, this type of microbiome is associated with a lower rate of developing metabolic disorders and obesity, as well as improved gut barrier function, reduced body weight, and improved glucose and fat metabolism.[2-4]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The LGC microbiome include species such as:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Bacteroides &nbsp;</li>\r\n\t<li>Ruminococcus gnavus</li>\r\n\t<li>Parabacteroides</li>\r\n\t<li>Campylobacter</li>\r\n\t<li>Dialister</li>\r\n\t<li>Porphyromonas</li>\r\n\t<li>Staphylococcus</li>\r\n\t<li>Anaerostipes</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The LGC-dominant microbiome tends to be more pro-inflammatory and is associated with insulin resistance and leptin resistance, higher body-fat mass, dysregulated fat metabolism, and a pattern of gaining more weight over time&mdash;even when controlling caloric intake.[5]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With that as a backdrop, here&#39;s how a contest diet may actually set someone up for bingeing tendencies and weight gain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Under conditions of caloric restriction, when carbohydrates and fats are both restricted and body-fat mass is very low, the body releases less leptin, which is the hormonal peptide that monitors energy availability and expenditure in the body. Leptin tells you when you are full and when you should be feeling hungry based on your energy stores. It protects against starvation, and lower leptin levels will make you feel hungrier&mdash;a common occurrence pre- and post-competition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Having low leptin means it takes you longer to feel full after eating. In one study comparing 67 women with eating disorders and 25 healthy women, researchers found that leptin was high in those with binge-eating disorders and low in those suffering from anorexia and bulimia.[6]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Human biochemistry adapts further by suppressing reproductive and thyroid function and by stimulating the HPA axis (Hypothalamus-Pituitary-Adrenal axis).&nbsp;Suppressing thyroid function also suppresses metabolism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Bringing It All Together</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Competitors typically become very hungry as their competition nears. Restricted-carbohydrate diets lead to cravings for carbohydrate foods. Low leptin due to ultra-low body fat signals the body to eat more, initiating bingeing-type behavior post-competition. It takes longer to feel full, so you feel as if you just can&#39;t stop eating. By the time leptin secretion kicks in, it may be a lot more than necessary, which may result in leptin resistance. Likewise, insulin will be released to cope with the increased intake of carbohydrates, which will lead to the storage of a lot of sugar in fat cells. (All carbohydrate besides fiber is broken down into sugars.) On top of this, your thyroid function is suppressed, another development promoting rapid weight gain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&#39;s an additional factor at work here affecting fat metabolism, and that&#39;s the gut microbiome. As mentioned above, when it comes to fat loss, the goal is to encourage the growth of HGC organisms and butyrate producers because HGC organisms promote insulin and leptin sensitivity, regulate inflammation, and regulate fat and sugar metabolism. At the same time, it&#39;s important to discourage the growth of too many LGC organisms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Diet is the main factor influencing this microbial gene richness and thus your ability to lose weight, independent of the calories consumed in your diet. As an example, a long-term diet low in fiber but high in animal proteins and fats has been found to favor the growth of Bacteroides spp., while a diet low in fiber but with a higher content of simple carbohydrates favors Prevotella spp.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What types of food play a role in the microbiome and its effect on fat loss?</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>Dietary Polyphenols</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Dietary polyphenols are bioactive compounds found in fruits, vegetables, and some grains, most notably in the skins and peels of colorful fruits and vegetables. They have modbiotic-like properties that can influence the microbial richness of the gut.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Poorly absorbed in the small intestine, polyphenols travel through to the large intestine, where they are metabolized by gut bacteria into various metabolites that either help regulate the ratios of bacteria in the gut environment or are absorbed into the bloodstream where they provide more systemic benefits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The intake of in-season polyphenols has also been associated with improved HPA axis signaling and improved leptin signaling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Various types of polyphenols have been shown to encourage the growth of HGC bacterial organisms such as Akkermansia&nbsp;and Bifidobacteria,[9] while decreasing the growth of LGC organisms such as Staphylococcus,&nbsp;Bacteroidaceae, and Clostridium perfrigens.&nbsp;Examples of foods that have high polyphenol content include green tea, apple peel, pomegranate peel, skins of berries, citrus fruits, and black rice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>Dietary Fiber</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Dietary fiber is metabolized into short-chain fatty acids by colonic bacteria in the large intestine. Three main short-chain fatty acids are formed:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Butyrate</li>\r\n\t<li>Acetate</li>\r\n\t<li>Propionate</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>These substances help to support the gut and feed the gut cells to keep them healthy. They can also feed into the energy cycles of cells to keep them going.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ratio between butyrate and acetate is often used as a predictor of metabolic syndrome or other metabolic disorders characterized by glucose and fat dysregulation, with a higher butyrate-to-acetate ratio associated with easier weight loss. The type of short-chain fatty acids produced depends on the type of microorganisms residing in your gut and your diet. Aim for about 25 grams of fiber per day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not all fibers are fermented to produce butyrate, though. Resistant starch and soluble fiber support butyrate production while low-starch fibers don&#39;t seem to aid it much.[14] Examples of foods that support butyrate production include oats, rice, potatoes, sweet potatoes, legumes, broccoli, green peas, apples, berries, and pears.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>The Bottom Line</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Dietary restrictions are a part of life for many people who are into fitness. For those engaged in calorie and carbohydrate restriction, adding low-caloric supplementary polyphenols, fiber, or both may help them achieve their competition goals while preventing changes to the gut microbiome that may interfere with fat loss going forward.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Addressing thyroid inhibition, gut microbiome diversity, and insulin and leptin resistance post-competition offers other tools for preventing excessive post-competition weight gain.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5><strong>References</strong></h5>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Qin, Junjie, et al.

But new research suggests that regular exercise has another major role to play in promoting heart health by encouraging something called &quot;cardiomyogenesis.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cardio-what? Let me explain. Cut your finger, and new skin cells grow to heal the wound. Break a bone, and it heals, too. Your arteries, liver, intestines, lungs, and, it appears, even your brain have similar healing properties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Until a decade ago, scientists thought the heart was incapable of creating new heart cells after birth.[1] Scientists pointed to this apparent inability to create new heart cells as a leading cause of chronic heart disease.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That thinking changed in 2009, when Canadian researchers showed that the heart can indeed create new cells, a process known as the aforementioned cardiomyogenesis. That triggered related findings from researchers at Harvard Medical School, Harvard Stem Cell Institute, and Massachusetts General Hospital, who showed that exercise might play a major role in improving the heart&#39;s ability to grow new cells.[2] Over eight weeks, the researchers compared the rate of new heart cell growth among mice that exercised daily with mice that didn&#39;t exercise at all. They found that regular running exercise enabled the active mice to create new heart cells five times faster than the inactive mice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Earlier studies with mice showed that the loss of as few as 23 of every 10,000 heart cells is enough to cause fatal heart disease\" src=\"https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2018/may/the-surpristing-way-exercise-helps-your-heart-1-700xh.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Earlier studies with mice showed that the loss of as few as 23 of every 10,000 heart cells is enough to cause fatal heart disease.[3] A large myocardial infarction can destroy about 1 billion heart cells.[4]&nbsp;Other studies have shown that the loss of this approximate number of heart cells in humans leads to the same disease.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Harvard researchers could not say exactly how many new heart cells the exercise routine would create. However, they could say that the number of new heart cells made possible by regular exercise is probably more than enough to counteract the loss of heart cells that results in fatal heart disease. The researchers also showed that even an injured heart is capable of creating new heart cells.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Research into cardiomyogenesis parallels research into whether brains can grow new cells, a process known as neurogenesis. The prevailing wisdom has been that, like the heart, the brain undergoes the vast majority of its growth while the fetus is in the womb, with limited growth continuing into infancy. Now, the inability of the brain to create new brain cells is being questioned, just as the heart was a decade ago.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ability of these key organs to regenerate themselves has major implications for the fight against heart disease, Alzheimer&#39;s, and other debilitating or fatal conditions of the heart and brain. In the meantime, this is just another great reason to use the treadmill!</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>References:</h4>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Bergmann, O., Bhardwaj, R.

Not today, bro. Here are five ways to melt your face, and your body fat, at the end of any workout. You don&#39;t even have to count reps when you do it!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s time for the post-workout cardio you promised yourself you would add in. But 30 minutes on the treadmill sounds about as appealing as getting a root canal. So, you&#39;re left with two choices: Slog through it, or go home early knowing you shorted your training.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At JKConditioning, we are big fans of secret option number three: Replace that bland cardio routine with simple, sweaty conditioning work. Think of conditioning work as cardio for gym bros. You certainly won&#39;t be using a treadmill or elliptical for any of these challenging finishers! You&#39;ll do straightforward work, feel it from head to toe, and know you did something substantial.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>1. Kettlebell Swing Intervals</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Kettlebell Swing Intervals\" src=\"https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2019/november/cardio-for-gym-bros-inset-1-700xh.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The kettlebell swing is a fantastic conditioning tool, and a favorite with our clients. Yes, some people experience some lower back discomfort with swings at first, but this can usually be remedied with some form correction. Here are&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/kettlebell-explosion-harness-the-power-of-the-kettlebell-swing.html\">the basics</a>:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Set up with a hip-width stance and grab the bell with an overhand grip. &nbsp;</li>\r\n\t<li>Hinge at the hip (don&#39;t squat) and rock the bell slightly backward to build some momentum. Pull it up between your legs (don&#39;t worry, you won&#39;t damage anything).</li>\r\n\t<li>Forcefully thrust your hips forward, similar to locking out a deadlift.</li>\r\n\t<li>As your hips come forward, your arms should float upward to bellybutton or chest level, carrying the bell with them. The timing here is key. If the hip extension is out of sync with the movement of the arms, the bell will not go very high.</li>\r\n\t<li>Get tall at the top, but not leaning back into the lower back. Control the height of the bell with your arms. It doesn&#39;t need to go higher than your arms being parallel to the ground.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Swings lend themselves well to a time-based approach. Nobody wants to count reps on this explosive move! For a killer conditioning finisher, set an interval timer for a 20-second work period and 40-second rest period. Swing for 20, rest 40, and complete 10 rounds.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>2. Rowing Machine Sprints</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The rowing machine is easily the most challenging piece of cardio equipment in the gym. It&#39;s easy to tell because if you walk into any large commercial gym, the treadmills and ellipticals are always full, and the rowers are gathering dust. Consider this an endorsement! A well-made rower demands you use both the arms and legs intensively, creating a unique challenge for the body that few other cardio machines can match.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We like distance intervals with the rower as opposed to timed intervals. Get creative with these! Too much routine goes hand in hand with boredom, and boredom is definitely an issue that many people face when it comes to cardio.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To get started, try 10 sprints of 100 meters. Don&#39;t worry, the machine will do the counting for you! Rest the same amount of time it took you to complete the sprint. You will likely start out doing these in 20 seconds or less, but the times will quickly creep up as you proceed through the sets.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>3. Loaded Carries For Distance</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Loaded carries are a classic conditioning tool and can be done in many different ways. The most common variation is the farmer&#39;s carry. With this carry, you simply grab one or two heavy dumbbells, hold them at your sides with you arms extended and your shoulders rolled back, and walk. This can also be done with a trap bar if you have the space.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Loaded Carry for Distance\" src=\"https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2019/november/cardio-for-gym-bros-inset-2-700xh.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other, less frequently used carries include:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>Zercher carry:</strong>&nbsp;The bar is held in the crease of your elbow. (An EZ-bar can work well for this.)</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Overhead carry:</strong>&nbsp;Dumbbells or a plate are held overhead with full arm lockout.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Yoke carry:</strong>&nbsp;A specialized rig called a yoke is held across the shoulders.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>For any variation of loaded carry, you can program it for time or distance. But given how a gym is usually a fixed space, time is a great place to start.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For time, start with 30 seconds of carrying followed by 60 seconds of rest, and complete 8 rounds. If you are going for distance, try 10 rounds of 20 yards (or thereabouts) with 45-60 seconds of rest between each round.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>4. Fan Bike Sprints</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Chances are, if anything on this list is going to make you lose your lunch, this is it. No matter if you call it a fan bike, AirDyne, or Assault Bike, this is a cruel piece of equipment. If the rowers are gathering dust at your local gym, the fan bike has cobwebs growing on it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What&#39;s so good and bad about it? We detailed it in the article &quot;<a href=\"https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/the-misery-machine-4-brutal-fan-bike-workouts.html\">The Misery Machine: 4 Brutal Fan-Bike Workouts</a>,&quot; but the short version is that the resistance on this bike is provided by a giant fan, so the harder you push yourself, the harder this piece of equipment is going to push back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The fan bike usually comes equipped with two great interval options programmed into the bike&#39;s software. The first is a 10/20&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/the-real-tabata-a-brutal-circuit-from-the-protocols-inventor.html\">Tabata-style</a>&nbsp;interval: 10 seconds of sprinting followed by 20 seconds of rest for 8 total rounds. Can&#39;t go wrong with that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the brave, the bike also has a 20/10 interval, also for 8 total rounds. If you are feeling ambitious, give that one a try.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I know what you may be thinking: &quot;Only 4 minutes? That&#39;s nothing.&quot; Be warned though: There is a reason this bike is a favorite among CrossFitters. Your lungs will burn, and no amount of water will help. And your legs will be ready to explode from acid and lactate accumulation. Enjoy!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>5. Sled Pushes</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>There is a reason that human beings invented the wheel: It clearly makes it easier to move heavy loads over distances. If you want a challenging conditioning workout, though, easy is your enemy. That&#39;s why you are going to drop the wheels, embrace your inner ox, and push a heavy sled.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Sled Pushes\" src=\"https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2019/november/cardio-for-gym-bros-inset-3-700xh.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sled pushes will not only make your lungs burn, they will strengthen your glutes, hamstrings, and calves better than most other exercises&mdash;all without the joint stress of heavy deads or squats.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The set-up for the push is simple:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Load up a sled with some weights. When loading the sled, be conscious of the surface you will be pushing on. The amount of friction makes a big difference. Pushing on grass turf is much easier than pushing on conventional rubber gym flooring or parking lot asphalt.</li>\r\n\t<li>Get low, and keep your chest puffed out. You can push with your arms extended or get closer to the sled by bending your arms&mdash;whatever feels best.</li>\r\n\t<li>Start pushing, focusing on bringing your knees high and digging your feet into the floor to generate a powerful push each time.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Similar to the loaded carry, you can program the sled push for time or distance. For distance, try a 30-yard push followed by 45-60 seconds of rest and complete 10 rounds. For time, try a 30-second push followed by a 60-second rest for 8 rounds.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Feel The Good Pain</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The workouts above all have two things in common: They will make you question your choices while you&#39;re doing them, but also keep you seriously focused and engaged on the task at hand. You can&#39;t say that about &quot;normal&quot; cardio!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you do find yourself getting accustomed to these though, try combining them! You could do kettlebell swings alternated with loaded carries, rower sprints with loaded carries, sled pushes with kettlebell swings, and many other combos.
