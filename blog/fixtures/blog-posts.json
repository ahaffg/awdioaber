        "description": "Steven Stone looks at two divergent views on power cords…",
        "text": "Cable discussions can turn normally rational audiophiles into nut-cases. I know. 
        I’ve been reading and watching the discussions since I wired up my first stereo system. 
        Recently I decided to ask two industry participants their take on power cords. 
        My question was, “How can a basic stock AC power cable negatively affect audio gear?” 
        Here are two divergent viewpoints…
        From Tommy O’Brien, (Digital Amplifier Company).
        The most important feature of a power cord for amplifiers is simple resistance. Other factors such as capacitance, 
        inductance, and shielding, are “in the noise” and not significant enough to affect 
        the sound of even the most revealing audio systems.",

        "description": " Is the HIFIMAN Sundara Closed Back better than the original Sundara? Each model has its selling points. The Closed Back seems to be unveiled, but it lacks some low-end grunt which can be easily remedied up to a point. So there is the tradeoff. Very good midrange definition. Excellent isolation levels and very little bleed. Beautiful Beechwood cups",
