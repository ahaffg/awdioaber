        "title": "With Headphones and Shoes the Fit is More Important Than Anything Else",
        "description": "Steven Stone looks at why an under £300 headphone can be better than a £1000 one…",
        "content": "Last week, on a Facebook group page dedicated to headphones someone posted a 
        query about which pair of premium headphones the group would recommend they purchase. 
        The responses were as expected, with partisans of one or another of the models listed 
        singing their praises and indicating that they would be the best choice. I, of course, 
        disagreed with all these recommendations. My suggestion was, 'Try each one on for 
        fifteen minutes. You will then know which one to buy.'

        Notice that I did not say, 'Listen to each one for fifteen minutes…' Most likely 
        the prospective owner will be listening during their 'try-on time' so in some way 
        considering the sound is a given. But if two headphones have the same approximate 
        level of sound quality, any sane audiophile is going to choose the one that is more 
        comfortable at the end of the listening session. It’s important to wait at least a 
        full fifteen minutes of on-head time. Why? Because some headphones that feel OK
        when you first put them on your head (or into your ear canals if they are in-ears)
        can become oppressive by the end of fifteen minutes. You need to know this before
        you make the mistake of buying them. 
            
            Over the course of the last five years I’ve reviewed a wide variety of earphones, 
            some priced under $20 and some approaching five figures when you add in the 
            headphone amplifier. While I’m sure I would be thoroughly chastised by commenters 
            if I claimed there are under $100 headphones that are “better” than £1000 ones, 
            but I have experienced £300 headphones that I preferred using to several multi-thousand 
            dollar ones I’ve reviewed. And yes, in every case it was the fit that made the less 
            expensive headphones a better option for me.

            Head sizes and shapes are as variable and idiosyncratic as feet, and as someone 
            who appreciates finely-made footwear, I am quite familiar with what a good fit feels 
            like as well as what one that is not quite right can do to you during the course of a 
            day. Just as one company’s 9 1/2 B sized shoe is not necessarily the same size as 
            another company’s 9 ½ B, a headphone that “fits most heads perfectly” could very well 
            not fit your head optimally. With shoes whether the fit is right can be pretty obvious, 
            sometimes with headphones it takes a bit longer. All the on-line and mail-order shoe 
            outlets have liberal 'return if not satisfied' policies, headphone sales sites need to 
            be equally liberal.
            
            Trying before buying means is much easier if you have a local retailer who carries 
            what you are interested in purchasing. In some places, like Denver, that’s easily 
            done – a trip to Listen Up, followed by a trip to Crescendo Audio will give a headphone 
            fancier a chance to try the vast majority of premium brands. If you live in a less 
            well retail-endowed part of the country there are mail-order headphone specialists 
            such as Moon Audio who realize that items could be returned because the fit isn’t optimal.

            Let me clarify one last thing before we part company – I am not saying that sound 
            quality does not matter, it certainly does; but that in the long run how a pair of 
            headphones or earphones fit is going to have a greater bearing on how much you use 
            and enjoy them than their sound quality alone, no matter how stellar that sound 
            quality may be.",

        "title": "Older Stax Earspeakers – Keeping Them Going with New Parts",
        "description": "Steven Stone discovers that finding parts for more venerable Stax Earspeakers is getting harder…",
        "content": "A couple of weeks ago I received an email from an old friend and bandmate regarding his Stax headphones. 
        He contacted me because I was the “expert” who recommended he purchase a pair of Stax earspeakers for his home 
        recording studio.

        While my friend loved the sound of the two pairs of Stax he had, they were both no longer functional. His Stax 
        SR-407 had a broken yoke while his pair of original Lambda Signatures had a broken headband. He had looked into 
        getting replacement parts but had come upon a series of dead ends and he was, to use his words, “Had it” with 
        the Stax’s physical delicacy. He wanted to be rid of both of these earspeakers along with the SRM-3 headphone 
        amplifier.
        
        I used to own quite a few Stax earspeakers, but I sold off all the oldest ones. Currently I only have a pair 
        of SR-X, a pair of Nova Signatures, and an SRM-007t headphone amplifier. After talking on the phone we agreed 
        to a trade – I would take his Stax gear in exchange for two pairs of headphones and a headphone amplifier. I 
        traded two recently discontinued and extremely well-built and comfortable headphones that I knew would stand 
        up to whatever rigors he could subject them to as well as a tube-based headphone amp to drive them. And then 
        I began my own search for parts to make at least one pair of earspeakers usable.

        Finding parts for the newer SR-407 earspeakers wasn’t hard, but it was not inexpensive. Woo Audio, who sell 
        Stax earspeakers on their website, also stock some Stax parts, including earpads and headband/yoke assemblies. 
        A new headband assembly for the SR-407 set me back $120US. Yes, that does seem pricy for such an insignificant 
        assemblage of plastic parts, but that’s the cost. At least I was able to “add value…”

        I mentioned that I already owned a pair of Nova Signature Pro earspeakers. I had them so long and used them so 
        much that the headband had gotten to the point where the friction sliders for adjustment needed to be wired 
        into place since the friction was nil and the leather headband part had to be modified with a handknitted 
        'headband cozy' that I wrote about back in 2016. While this has worked, it is a bit too Grandma Moses for my 
        tastes.
        
        Since I only needed one of the yokes from the new headband part from Woo, I replaced the headband and leather 
        slider assemblies on my Nova Signatures with new ones from the SR-407. Now I had TWO working Stax headphones 
        for the price of one new headband part.

        If only replacing the headband for the older Lambda Signature Pros were as easy…

        Neither Woo nor any of my other sources for parts had any headbands for earlier Stax Lambda pros. Unfortunately, 
        the headbands for the SR-407/Nova Pros will not fit the older Stax because the yoke mounting holes on the older 
        Stax is only half the diameter of the later Stax. The Earspeaker capsules themselves are identical looking, so 
        you could resort to enlarging the older Pros’ holes with a hand drill, which is not without risk. If I can’t 
        find the parts after a couple of months of searching on EBAY I may resort to the hand drill route.
        
        During this whole project I kept wondering if there wasn’t, perhaps, a ready market for some enterprising audio 
        firm to make replacement Stax headbands for older models. I’m not advocating clones of the originals, but better 
        headbands, perhaps employing metal rather than plastic? Given the high cost of the originals, there could be 
        enough margin for a “better” aftermarket headband that could even be priced at or above the cost of the current 
        plastic ones. Heck, even a Grado headband could be adapted with newly-fabricated replacement yokes for Stax 
        use…and the final result would be much more rugged than the originals…",

        "title": "Headphones Gone Wild!",
        "description": "Steven Stone looks at headphones yearly sales growth that shows that humans like sticking 
        wireless stuff into their ears…",
        "content": "Yesterday I received the latest sales figures for headphones from the most excellent researchers at 
        Futuresource Consulting. They found revenues from headphones had, in their words, “surged” 26% in the last quarter, 
        Q3. So far for the year, headphones sales have accounted for $5.5US billion worldwide.

        In his report Futuresource Consulting research analyst Luke Pearce found, “All this activity is the result of 
        consumers demanding more features, as they seek to upgrade & spend money on products for new emerging use 
        cases in the aftermarket for headphones. Within in-ear, wireless and true wireless headphones are drawing 
        the crowds. For the over-ear segment, sales are being fueled by demand for wireless too, but combine this 
        with noise-cancelling technology and your product could be high on a consumer’s wish list. Sales of Bose’s 
        QC 35 II, still performing well even after a year of sales…” 

        Jerry Del Colliano reviewed the Bose QC35 for Home Theater Review, and I covered them for another publication. 
        We both agreed that their ergonomics, noise cancelling, battery life, fit, and design was first rate. 
        The only thing they lacked was anything above mediocre, polite sound. So far, the only Bluetooth/wireless 
        headphones I’ve heard that you can begin to take seriously from a sonics point of view are those equipped 
        with Bluetooth 4.2 and either aptX HD or Sony’s LDAC protocols.

        Luke Pearce also includes this interesting fact, “Shipments of true wireless headphones doubled in volume 
        year-on-year, while revenues for this category grew to within striking distance of $1 billion…One in every 
        ten sets of true wireless headphones sold in the quarter were marketed for sports.” 

        It’s obvious that the reason for this explosion of growth in wireless headsets of all kinds stems from the 
        simple fact that wireless headsets are far more ergonomically elegant than wired ones. And most humans would 
        prefer, if given the choice, wireless headphones. It also indicates that utility, not sound quality, is the 
        primary reason for wireless headphones purchase. 

        For audiophiles there is plenty of good news on the wireless headphone front – the latest generation of 
        premium smart phones and portable players are supporting the higher-level Bluetooth codecs so when connected 
        to a headphone that also supports higher resolution codecs the results are, in some cases, sonically 
        on par with a wired headphone. Bluetooth wireless headphones can be musically involving and are certainly 
        worthy of an audiophile’s attention.

        When it comes to wireless headphones, sound quality is a feature that only comes into play when the devices 
        move into price ranges where they have already exhausted more in-demand ergonomic features. 

        If you look at 'smart speakers' you see the same trends – people are buying smart speakers not due to their 
        sound quality, but their ergonomics. The irony, from an audiophile point of view, is that according to Digital 
        Music News smart speakers’ primary function is playing music. According to Deloitte Global Consumer Survey 
        respondents between the age of 18 and 75 years use their smart speakers to play music 60% of the time. Also, 
        according to the study, 'smart speakers will be a $7 billion business by the end of 2019. That’s a 63 percent 
        jump over 2018 projected revenues of $4.3 billion, and just one of several bullish projections for smart speakers.' 
        An article released recently on Fast Company states, '…most of the smart speakers sold cost far less than the 
        HomePod. Smart speakers with prices between £200 and £400 made up only 5% of unit sales.'

        This all reinforces what I’ve written in other blogs – except in very rare cases audiophiles will not 
        find smart speakers to be anything but mid-fi devices.

        When you look at the sales numbers generated by wireless headphones and smart speakers, it’s easy to see that 
        improvements in the sound quality of devices destined for the vast majority of humans are not going to improve 
        drastically with the next wave of wireless earphones and smart speakers, except for those willing to opt for 
        premium-priced options. 

        So, those engaged in the hobby of audiophilia can rest assured that they will remain as marginalized in this 
        new age of smart phones, streaming, and wireless audio, as they have been throughout the history of consumer 
        audio products…",
