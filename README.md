## Backstory
For my fourth Milestone project with Code Institute I want to create a n app that will really push me outside of my comfort zone and show my ability to create solutions to problems outside my field of knowledge.
My father gave me the initial seed of an idea that I should build an app for my husband. So, from there, this is how the idea had grown.

My husband is an audiophile. This means that he ~~spends all our savings on expensive MP3players~~ collects, tests and reviews audio equipment. Over the past few years he has built up a global network of contacts with audio companies and manufacturers, professional reviewers and journalists and members of the music industry.  
His primary hub for this has been [Head-Fi](https://www.head-fi.org/), a forum for audio enthusiasts. Here this community exchange opinions on equipment and over time, if (like my husband) their opinions are trusted and respected, they are often approached to review equipment on behalf of companies such as Bang and Olufsen or for their advice on equipment by musicians. *ahem* Nine Inch Nails *ahem*.

I seem to forever be posting and receiving equipment for my husband to the point where it feels like our home is part of an audio equipment conveyor belt! Members of this community are always swapping equipment as a sort of informal “try before you buy” arrangement. We especially are challenged by our location (living in far west Wales) and are unable to pop to a local audio shop to browse or buy.
Also, sites like Amazon and Ebay are not ideal for selling as the second-hand market is treacherous for sellers with the risk of unhappy customers and high commission costs.
To that end, based on what I see as an opportunity within this community and driven by my husband’s knowledge and passion, I want to build an app that would allow my husband to establish as formal membership programme whereby members could sign up to hire equipment either to buy or just to try.
