            <br>
            These Rules and Terms of Use are unabashedly inspired by those so effectively in use at Audio Asylum and a

            Although the administrators and moderators of Awdio Aber will attempt to keep all objectionable messages off
            this forum, it is impossible for us to review all messages. All messages express the views of the author,
            and the owners of Awdio Aber will not be held responsible for the content of any message.<br>
            <br>
            By agreeing to these rules, you warrant that you will not post any messages that are obscene, vulgar,
            sexually-oriented, hateful, threatening, or otherwise violative of any laws.<br>

            <ol>
                <li data-xf-list-type="ol">Be polite. We encourage debating in the forums, but please avoid defamatory
                    statements, personal attacks, racial slurs, name-calling, and cursing at others in the forums.</li>
                <li data-xf-list-type="ol">Awdio Aber's forums are generally geared for headphone high fidelity
                    enthusiasts, but the several categories of forums within Awdio Aber generally allow for discussion of
                    general audio topics and even completely non-headphone / non-audio / non-music topics (e.g., the
                    Members' Lounge forum). We ask that you please make a concerted effort to post in the appropriate
                    forums.</li>
                <li data-xf-list-type="ol">Considering that our member base is made up of people from a wide range of
                    ages, from pre-adults to senior citizens -- and also a great variety of cultures, beliefs and social
                    standards -- swearing on the forums is not allowed. Our general standard is this: if it would not be
                    allowed on U.S. network primetime television, it will most likely not be allowed on Awdio Aber's
                    forums. If you need further clarification, feel free to contact a moderator.</li>
                <li data-xf-list-type="ol">Do not post copyrighted or trademarked material without first obtaining the
                    express permission to do so by the copyright or trademark holder or a legally authorized agent of
                    the copyright or trademark holder. In short, this means no posting verbatim copies of copyrighted
                    articles or logos without first obtaining the proper permission to do so.</li>
                <li data-xf-list-type="ol">If what you want to post includes words/phrases like "placebo," "expectation
                    bias," "ABX," "blind testing," etc., please post it in the Sound Science forum.</li>
                <li data-xf-list-type="ol">We do not allow the discussion of politics or religion in any of our forums.
                </li>
                <li data-xf-list-type="ol">Do not cross-post. (Cross-posting is posting the same post to more than one
                    thread, or the same thread to more than one forum.)</li>
                <li data-xf-list-type="ol">Use only one username. Multiple profiles for the same individual are not
                    allowed. Use of multiple profiles may result in an immediate ban.</li>

                        class="link link--external" rel="noopener">feedback@Awdio Aber.org</a> to notify them of an interest

                    becomes a Member of the Trade, they must notify the forum administrator of the change in status. After
                    notification of the "Member of the Trade" status, the forum administrator will then add a “Member of
                    the Trade” custom title to the member’s profile with the business name.</li>
                <li data-xf-list-type="ul">A Member of the Trade may not post announcements, advertisements, sales
                    information or the like, including classifieds or pictures, about a product he makes or sells in the

                    Using Awdio Aber Private Messaging for unsolicited advertising may result in at least a temporary ban

                    Awdio Aber Private Messaging or e-mail. Please note, though, that it is not our desire to see Group
                    Buys used by Members of the Trade as a primary method of distribution and advertising on Awdio Aber's
                    forums--so, for this and other reasons, they are usually not approved. Exceptions may be made on a
                    case-by-case basis, and most often for DIY-related parts that might otherwise be unreasonably
                    difficult to obtain.</li>

                    personal video you wish to post, it must be embedded in the post.This rule was put in place because
                    there has been an increasing tendency for people to simply redirect people to their video channels

            <b>Publicly Accessible Areas of the Service and Private Messaging</b><br>
            <br>
            "Publicly accessible" areas of the Service are those areas of Awdio Aber that are intended by Awdio Aber's
            management to be available to the general public. By way of example, publicly accessible areas of the
            Service would include Awdio Aber Message Boards that are open to both members and visitors. However, publicly
            accessible areas of the Service would not include portions of Awdio Aber that are limited to members. The use
            of the the Private Messaging Service is not “Private” in the sense that it is a message seen only by the
            sender and receiver. While the message is private from the rest of the members, it is not encrypted and the
            administration of Awdio Aber can view them if needed. All rules that apply to posting on the Main Forums ALSO
            apply to the use of our Private Messaging System and violators may have their posting privileges subject to
            the same revocations as on the Forum in general.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Security</b><br>
            <br>
            Awdio Aber is very concerned with safeguarding your information. We employ reasonable physical, technological,
            and administrative security measures and attempt to ensure they are applicable under the circumstances. No
            method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.
            Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we
            cannot guarantee its absolute security.<br>
            <br>
            We will make any legally required disclosures of any breach of the security, confidentiality, or integrity
            of your unencrypted electronically stored “personal data” (as defined in applicable state statutes on
            security breach notification) to you via email or conspicuous posting on this Site in the most expedient
            time possible and without unreasonable delay, insofar as consistent with (i) the legitimate needs of law
            enforcement or (ii) any measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable
            integrity of the data system.<br>
            <br>
            <b>International Transfer</b><br>
            <br>
            Your information may be transferred to — and maintained on — computers located outside of your state,
            province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as
            those in your jurisdiction. If you are located outside the United States and choose to provide information
            to us, Awdio Aber transfers Personal Information to the United States and processes it there. Your consent to
            this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such information represents your agreement to that
            transfer.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Links to Other Sites</b><br>
            <br>
            The Site contains links to other websites. If you choose to visit an advertiser by “clicking on” a banner ad
            or other type of advertisement, or click on another third-party link, you will be directed to that third
            party’s website. The fact that we link to a website or present a banner ad or other type of advertisement is
            not an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with that third party, nor is it an
            endorsement of their privacy or information security policies or practices. We do not exercise control over
            third-party websites. These other websites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer,
            collect data or solicit personal information from you. Other sites follow different rules regarding the use
            or disclosure of the personal information you submit to them. We encourage you to read the privacy policies
            or statements of the other websites you visit.<br>
